The scattergrams did not look that good. That is Past. Gotta do a lot of things today. The Blacksmith Planxty. Heart rate’s looking pretty good. Still around the 60 range. Blood oxygen can be higher though. Getting out on Thursday. We’ve also got to do test corrections. Denis Villeneuve. Judas and Cassius. Wall of Fluid. Own mints. Go and get showered. Productive evening. We went through everything. Go through Greek before next class.
