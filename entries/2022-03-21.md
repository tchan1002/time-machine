Senior spring is going well thus far. Printmaking. Looking forward to Salman Rudshdie. Picked up a copy of the Road. Ultimate Frisbee 4:20 Rink A. The White Tiger. Salman Rushdie delivered. Ultimate Frisbee was a no go. Messed around with Joy and Gretl at Ransom. Show up to practice tomorrow. Went out to Grill at night. Chinese literature goes crazy. Have to reevaluate. The Universation Literature. Dubliners, Shanghaiers, Humans. Asked a question on Amazon. Check back. The creation of an instant. Representing the hot voice of india. Inherently political, so let it be. Finnegan’s wake, what the hell.

Reading Rushdie’s introduction to Midnight’s Children, I couldn’t help but think about To Live, a novel that I distinctly remember reading as a kid. It did not occur to me then that To Live is the story of modern China, of a people’s persistence despite the overwhelming tragedy of life. And the name of their resistance was unwavering optimism. 

“And the *mantou*, drenched in the blood of the martyr.”

Doctrine: On the flow of time in language. The greater the degree of description, the slower time flows. Time rests on perception, for each action carries with it a weight in the flow of time. 

To do:  
Hang out at Senior Grill  
Ask friends to hang out
