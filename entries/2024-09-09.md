**Day 12**  
Last two shakers in Sabbathday Lake, ME. Settled in the reg. Sent Shoshi an email. Garlic spread dip was pretty decent. Tim from the tech bar set us up with an antivirus. Drafted and published our article on medium and substack. Called Aboo outside the reg. Swinging balls of light on the bart quad. Made dinner. Made tea. Talked with Clancy till 1:30 in the morning. The capillaries of civilization. 

好健康，好靚仔.  
Aboo figured out how to screenshot.  
講來講去都係 “handsome boy”.

The first sin is sloth, the second sin is lack of focus. We cannot languish.   
Do coverage with quad scholars.  
The ring, the great dark, and proximity to god. 

Reconnect with James about trains. We enjoyed our month on the road. Came to respect writing as a way of recording for how unobtrusive it is, and how personal it can be.
