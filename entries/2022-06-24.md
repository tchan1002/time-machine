Day 88  
Apollo Loxias. The most Greek of them all. Put our clothes in the washer. Switch to the dryer at 12\. Make rice. Meat should be thawed out enough for use today. Jacqueline’s sick. Cooked rice. Driving today at 4:30. Annalisa tasked us with her snapchat streaks. Good Boeotia. Rice and eggs. Cinnamon rolls. Roe v Wade. Wilde. The Anchorite and the wild animals of the desert. The dawn remaking the world. Agnus Dei. Catholic Mass. Tannhauser. Went on a drive. ABBA Angeleyes. Go on a run after dinner? Walk down to the New Haven green tomorrow. Made fried rice with meat in tomato paste. F ing good. Green, yellow, white and ochre. Played codenames with Kirtland. Coup. Didn’t go running today. Performed our daily maintenance. Reset. Got a message on Fiverr. Our first gig? Talked to Jasper.

“Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known.”   
And all I have left is little stories of people in my head.

Remember to keep annalisa’s streak alive.
