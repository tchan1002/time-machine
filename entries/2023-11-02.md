Donâ€™t think we did too well on our micro exam. We move on. Went to our stats collab section. Dinner with Anderson, Claire, and Jayson. News about Beau. The sky. Had a really good talk with Raghav ahead of our sliced bread meeting. Ballad in A by Cathy Park Hong. Have to think about things. Our first photography gig?
