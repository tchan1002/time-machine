**Day 19**  
Slept till 11:00. Went out to meet Grace for dumplings. Bug bites. Realized we lost our house keys. Nevertheless. Back on the Columbia campus. Hung around with Christina before taking the train back to New Haven. Called Chloe, who set us as her legacy contact. Walked to a Walgreens for water. Sat outside Branford for a few. Met Clark at a good nature market. He took us in. Spent the night in Davenport. Roommate Tor lent us a pillow, for which we were thankful.
