Thinking seriously about this journal again. Focus on one thing at a time. Set up a log on google sheets. Read Gatsby. Remember why. Peaky Blinders. Let’s fill this thing back up again. Clinton Kane. Daniel Zhang. Letters to a young poet. Jack Kerouac. NaNoWriMo

Writing here has always been about practicalities. This year has been absolutely awful. God knows how many times we lost our hearts. Hard not to take a phoenix in Chicago as an omen—to be reborn in fire. We’re always talking about changes, and though we don’t see them yet, they are coming. We just have to hold on now. 

Dreamt of Will Park and some anime thing.
