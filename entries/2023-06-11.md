Day 89  
Gonggong got covid. Rode in an ambulance. Accompanied Gonggong to Queen Elizabeth. Packed our things. Relocated to Tai Po. Sanitized and showered. Long day. Not feeling so good. Coughing up a storm. Netflix on the big screen though. 

Dreamt that Will Park showed us to a Korean church, and that we went back and ran with the XC boys and Newbould on rain-swept streets.
