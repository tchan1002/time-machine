Slept in. Had breakfast with Lincoln and Bernardo, then Will and Saul. Watch geese take flight. David Foster Wallace, a fellow of infinite jest. Settled in the third floor lounge to knock out some agenda items while listening to some sweet tunes. Emberlynnâ€™s in our TAPs class. Galaxies gave us a fright. Called Jesalina. Arhon called. Read through essays. Went to Woodlawn with Gabby, Orange fan. Watched Zoolander with Sumin, Seth, Giancarlo and Sophie in the third floor lounge.
