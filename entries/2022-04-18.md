Monday. Woke up early at 5. Cam at breakfast. The tyranny of society. Get a suit on, grab a headshot. The origins of jury nullification. Take calculus over the summer? All the pretty people. Did our health assignment. Lunch seminars. Coconut crabs, medieval maps. Greek review. Got similarly butchered. Ultimate Frisbee. Charlie Knight and a collapsed tent. Hollywood, writer and actor. Went on a goose chase for Murderbot with Will Soh and Clara. Think we’ll go back and take a nap. Sike, found our copy on the opposite side of the shelf. Libraries are goated. Get the intro down for the assembly speaker. Shower. Figured out our speaker post. Instagram, a renaissance. The inevitable genesis of a supernova. Credible backstories. Had a really nice call with Amber. Made good progress on our Ted talk.

“You’re goated, please have my daughter’s hand in marriage.”
