A cold and dispassionate crowd. Had a really good talk with Peter from our FA class. *Exeter, Chicago, we’ve got something.* Figured out our FA stuff. Three bowls of soup with Alec and Max from UChicago Sailing. Dropped by the reg. Abecedarian. Talked to Judy at Ex Lib. We need a moodboard—branding is about knowing our customer. Went to SliC. Grabbed dinner at Baker. T-5 to finish our stats homework. Hosted our first study break. Brought home a little plant friend. Submitted our stats homework. We’re an extreme R goat. Made some really cool graphs. Shower and read so that we can compose an essay tomorrow. 

Start cold-emailing people. We really just need to do that.
