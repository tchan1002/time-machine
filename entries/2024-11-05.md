#### Must Do's
- [x] AppDev
- [x] Susan Sontag

 Terry Winograd on human computer interaction. Involved Interviewing. Grabbed food for our BM shift. Answered the Ida phone: a strange feeling to be on the other side of the line. Election day. Finished our AppDev homework. Cut it a little close. Read more of Susan Sontag. Looked through war photos from Afghanistan. Regarding the Pain of Others. Appdev. Followed [[Aabir ]]and [[Ashton]] to have dinner at the Nile with [[Leo Li]]. The falafel sandwich we had was really quite good. It was moist, especially with the tzaziki sauce. We could have had much more of it. Stopped by Aabir's. [[Anand]] showed us around a mixer, and Jonas in our involved interviewing class. Watch party at D-Nik. [[Marshall]] cooked up dogs. Kamala lost North Carolina. Kamalast lost all.

It's a curious feeling watching the election on a college campus. People fidgeting with their electoral maps to find a path for Harris, ever and ever more unlikely. *How can this be real?* It's a sinking feeling. The disappointment on people's faces is noticeable. Soph looked like they were going to cry.
