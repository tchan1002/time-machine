- [x] Stuff for Katy Nowhere

Woke up around 9:30. Launched Who's On. Breakfast. Character and Commerce at 11:00. Lunch with Ryan Sanghavi and Lola. Afternoon, sat in Baker and worked. Scheduled meals for the week. Wrote out a summary for Katy. Went back to North. Napped. Went to polo. 5 pullups. Watched the Decameron and made onion soup with Lola. Avoid heavy meals from now on. Keep working. 

Start thinking like a sharkâ€”sharks can't stop, so they feed.

[[Who's On?]] we need stronger visuals. 
Antics like pulling out giant checks is what will get us noticed.

[[Substack]]: when we write in a serial define colors. Use visual language. 
Chryostomos. "golden-mouthed" Chrysosomos "golden-bodied"
Dissect and reassemble.
