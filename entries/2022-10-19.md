Woke up. Walked and shuttled to our health center appointment. Achilles and Patroclus. Emailed Seraphina about our make-up exam. Figure out epsilon-delta proofs. The democratic man. Ate at Bart following sosc. Think we take tonight off. Commedia event on Monday. Having our math midterm tomorrow at two. Showered. Gabby got us some Hoffman’s pepper jacks. Don’t ruin this. Went to dinner at Woodlawn with Jack and Dellara. Coolcat. Called Holden and Jasper. Went through some epsilon-delta problems.

Coming weekend:  
Hum paper done  
Sosc first draft

Here we are, backs to the sea.  
Used to listen to Kygo a lot. Stargazing. 

Think we know how to do epsilon delta proofs.  
Do one tomorrow to refresh our memory.
