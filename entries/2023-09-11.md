Morning. Raining out. Brushed our teeth. Snacked on our bread and goat cheese log. Packed our stuff. Left for the reg. Settled on the A level. Wrote up and submitted our Singapore trek reflection. Add drop successful? Take portraits for people over O-Week. Eloisa to Abelard. RA training. Lifted weights. Ran into Michael Moran. The 15th floor multi-purpose room. Clouds over Chicago. Cristi gave us a tour of north. Saw some north apartments.
