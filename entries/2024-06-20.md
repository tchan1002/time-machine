**Day 92**  
Two-thirds into June. Had breakfast. Ran into Daniel in the morning. Dyson Spheres discovered? Zoomed Pen about consulting. Hung out with Jackie. Visited Mango town. Unironically watched half an hour of skibidi toilet. Helped Vanessa move her bed. Made plans for next Tuesday night. Got mad, ran and ended up doing 3x2 diags on the midway. Stay alive.

Run earlier in the day so we earn back time. Night run \+ shower frees us up.   
Don’t catch ourselves talking about girls. Go out there and make that video. Start holding ourselves accountable.

If we want to get people to come out it must be personal. Broadcasts have a low conversion rate. We have the time and sweat to do targeted advertising. 

Nearly a month of summer. Remember that we have something to prove\! Hustle—we’re good at that.
