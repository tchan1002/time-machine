Met a second year at Yale Med—Uma D. Alappan, and Sam Peltzman, professor emeritus, on our flight back to Chicago. Toronto, a field of lights nestled on the rim of a vast darkness. Continued our read of The Crying of Lot 49. Lyft back to Hyde Park via Elaine, in [[Vanessa]]'s lab. Grabbed fourth meal Baker before heading back up and going back to bed.

[[Gentleman from Algiers]]:
white smoke fuming out of car fuselages and people’s mouths
gentlemen from algiers picks us up in a black lincoln
asks us what temp it is from where we came
and we asked him where he was from and 
how’s the temperature there?
is it mediterranean
some places near the desert he says are very cold
in the daytime 150 degrees people get lost in cars and die out there
and at night when the sun goes down sub zero 
friend with a house in the desert has a hole in the ground
when it gets too hot he goes down
when it gets too cold he goes down
