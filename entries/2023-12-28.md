Day 6  
Woke up to sheep outside the window. Had some tea for breakfast. Played fact or crap in the downstairs lodge with mom and Chloe. Visited Williams, had lunch there. The Berkshires. Drove up to Vermont. Main Street Antique shop in Bennington: the store clerk there spoke some solid Cantonese. Indian Heads. Texted Kary. Dropped by an Aldi’s for groceries. *I’m an item\!* Sound of music. Kinda jarring to see actors wearing swastikas. Some car trouble on the way back, stranded by the roadside. Good samaritans got us back. Hello world\!

Magnolia, Tom Cruise’s wayward son.   
*I think you’re very cool but you scare me a little.*   
To be touched by a ladybug is a euphemism they use in Missouri.
