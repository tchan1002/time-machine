5 days left till school. Fresh off the boat. Awooga. Got a call from Max. Course materials came out. Get our fingernails clipped. Time to start the countdown. Wipe clean things. The Chair. Sonic the Hedgehog looks fire. Grind the Picture of Dorian Gray tomorrow so we can get to other stuff. Not a particularly productive day but that’s alright. Just have to get back up. The Family of Man. Did 50 fast ones in a row. Went out for a run. Made some edits on the UTL. Think we salvaged it today. Runs and showers give good opportunities to think. The last switch.

It happens without cause, it happens without reason, and all you can do is take it.
