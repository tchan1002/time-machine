Day 10  
Woke up. Took the train up to Shenzhen. Met dad at 福田. Ate at a seafood and congee restaurant. Went to the James Jean exhibit at the Seaworld Arts and Culture center. Reflective surfaces. Loved the sketches. Was a nice day. Obtained a tripod from Dad. Got back home before six. Had some soup for dinner.

Apotheosis, psychosis—a lack of self-identification with the past. Dogged, dogged hunger for an iterative evolution. Let’s go back to Chicago and be somebody. **Take up that camera.** Start a @humansoftoby. Sign up for arts articles. Develop our main. Transform sliced bread to be maroon arts. Use our budget to buy cameras?
