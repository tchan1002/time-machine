**Day 110**  
Sent in our senior pics en route to Valois. We plant seeds. Ate with Moran. Told him about our picnic idea. Signed and sent in our RA contract. We’ve made 1600 from photos this year. Took pictures for Kaya. Called Arhon—call our friends more. Went down to the point. Ran into Misaki. First dip of the summer. Freezing cold. Met a Jose from Colombia. Sasha and Ann came over. Small Cheval. Had such a nice meal with Annie and Joe and Cristi. What a year for us\! Groceries from target.

Stranger \#2: Jose from Barranquilla had moved to Chicago with his kid and wife (or as he says *woman)* a year ago. Got him to take a dunk in the lake with his blue swim shirt and trunks. The water was *mucho frio.*
