**Day 26**  
Met Einmon going into her third year at UVA. Just got her hot yoga teaching certificationâ€”we talked about Tibetan singing bowls. Arrived in DC in the afternoon. Took the metro to Foggy Bottom. Sat in a Whole Foods near GW. Lara and Maya. Nhan Phan called up everyone. Sensei Wu. Saw Willmo, saw Hayden. Sat down at Eppis. Exercises in nostalgia.
