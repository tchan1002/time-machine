#### Must Do's

Golden boy stay dreaming. Went down to Baker for breakfast. Sat at a back table and read. Make our interview guide impeccable. Out to meet [[Aabir]]. 80 degrees out and slight breeze. Very warm for December. Almost summer? Lunch at Small Cheval. Napped and showered. Went over to [[Vanessa]]'s. Made Khao Soi. Was really nice. Beads of sweat. Skated back and ran into Joe, Cristi, and Ugonna at the intersection by University. 

Infinite Backrooms. AI Goat memes. Look into nfts.

We're at 1K a month? get that up. 

Morality is alignment of inner reality with outer reality. AI is a radical alterity. 
Scent and taste may be last to hack in the achievement of verisimilitude.
