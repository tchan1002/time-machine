#### Must Do's
- [x] Run
- [x] Do 20 Pushups

Read Ishiguro. Booked hostels for Berlin and Hamburg. [[Germany Thoughts]]. Our left eye is twitching. How are we spending our first night in Hamburg? EXTREME STEALTH CAMPING. Watched Tenet. Think one way transmissions. Did 30 pushups. Called [[Aboo]] with [[Mom]] and [[Chloe]]. Went out to run. Down the road one mile, keen to avoid plantar fasciitis. Showered. In the midst of an imagined argument with Justin who stiffed us, we stopped to thinkâ€”how nice is it to have hot water? how nice it is to have food? how nice it is to see Mom and Chloe? Washed the dishes. Tenet, what a movie. 

Who was Catiline?
A vastus animus. Perhaps the original *eat the rich.*

Protect our mental space. The greatest act of kindness we can do this break is to treat our family well and love them.
