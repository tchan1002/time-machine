Sent Robert off. Had breakfast at Woodlawn before our Polisci discussion. The Kepler Orrery III. Submitted our Astro pset in the A level. Salmon at Baker. Hung out on the quad. Bernadette\! Old books at special collections. Medieval codices, Yerkes logbooks, and Chandrasekhar’s notebooks—they said he’d drive 90 minutes down to the university to teach two students. The Earth, no wandering star. Galilean dreams. Took a big nap. Grabbed a Dama rice bowl at Tiffins. Ran, went for a five miler up and down the midway. Had two Virgil’s craft vanilla sodas. Jesus wept. Visiting the Chicago Botanic garden with Ryan tomorrow.

The indentations of letters, hand-set, on cotton and linen, not pulp, they called the bite of the type. 

Little blue flowers growing out of the grass  
we’d pick their stems and suck on them  
like sweet lemons, we’d chew and spit  
As the magnolias, their wide-white petals,  
Reach towards us like fingers. 

Snippet: Last Sunday, the sun, archetype of resurrection, artificer of memory lent us dreams, past and pastoral, packed in frozen cream. And we said hollow lover, bringer of atomic fire, make us fish, so that we may swim in your summer shimmer. Or make us fly, so that with kaleidoscope eyes, we may be matters of transience, masters of subservience… 

Song: Bernadette by Reina del Cid.
