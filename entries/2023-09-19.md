Move-in day. Woke up at 7:30, met the crew downstairs. 4 buttons for eyes. Worked the afternoon elevator shift, a troll under the bridge. Genuinely exhausted by the day’s end. Had dinner at Baker with Annie and Jackson. Something to remember, the past is all a reconstructed history. Get out there. Maybe someday we’ll go back to longform reflection. 

Doctrine: Long exposure photography. Alexey Titarenko. City of shadows. St. Petersburg 1992\. Moving objects and people vanish in time. The bioluminescence of mushrooms. All just light and time. The camera’s perception is no less real than our eyes.
