Breakfast with Angel, DNik, from Andorra. Fears about food, an episode of burger patties slapped on the edge of the table. First day at Reynolds. Didn’t feel so good. Logan Party. Ran back to assemble the QR code. Became a billboard for a bit. 2am we’re spent. Cut our hair. Showered. Cleaned up. Take our hands off sliced bread.
