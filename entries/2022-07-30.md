Day 52  
Woke up at 4 to meet with Kiesse downstairs. Went with Unger at 5 to the airport. Flew to Charlotte. Ran into Kate Rose as our flight to Boston was delayed. Chilliam Turner. Bereal. Read Breasts and Eggs. Coca Cola Red Cans of Death. Landed in Boston. Thalassa, thalassa. Said goodbye to Gianluca, then Jasper. Took the T back home. Park St. Subway station. Subway stations, subterranean, magical places. We’ve got a lot to write. Had BBQ chicken. 

“An anime comes from a manga, and a manga comes from a script. If you go far back enough, is it a dot?”

Snippet: The light from the clouds pierced the walls of the plane as if inside a whale carcass unearthed, ivory ribs sifting through golden sand. And flying into the harbor, we spotted the ships in the distance, the blue, white on the tips of the waves and knew that we were home.
