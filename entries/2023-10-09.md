Got our religion essay back. We’re the goat. Grabbed a quick bite at Baker. Ran into Alicia, who gave us a blueberry cupcake for her birthday. Walked to the quad. The tour groups roving about campus in great herds. Did our religion reading on the A level. Had a really good talk with Anderson at lunch. Vienna by Billy Joel, the Politician. Worked on our micro pset with Yuto on the 5th floor. Hung out with Audrey. Stopped by our micro discussion. Up the red staircase of Ryerson. Saw the rings of Saturn. Reynolds, men in suits. Opened submissions for sliced bread at Hallowed. Went up to fourth meal. Fingertips rubbing the wrinkled skin of a dried apricot. Slept. *Swim or drown.*

Told Anderson this, that leaving mock feels like jumping off a cliff—because it’s nice to have people around—and truth be told, we’re scared by the void. But we do just have to get out there. If we can do anything, we can do it anywhere.  

Meta: Must realize that this journal is at once a reflection and a direction. How we think of ourselves becomes who we are. Writing about and for ourselves is a thing of tremendous power. We need to remember that. 

Song: Last Christmas by Wham.
