Grabbed breakfast with Alicia. Went out for groceries from Hyde Park Produce. Came back, applied to career treks, and picked up our laundry. Zoomed into a Maroon arts editors meeting. Showered. Wrote back to Dionte from Warner Records about Riovaz. Set up a link-tree, market ourselves as a concert photographer. Updated our resume. Called Ryan to ask if heâ€™d like to go see another puppet show. Wakka Wakka: the Immortal Jellyfish Girl. Invited the sliced bread editors up for a pasta dinner. Our name on the Chicago Puppet Theater Website.
