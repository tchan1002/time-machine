Went out to breakfast with Marcus on our floor, a fourth year. Talked with Mark about philosophy. Dreams of being a public intellectual. Daniel Schmidt. Puppy love of bygone years. Got our phone fixed at Tech Box. Inc. Revived. Tested the university shuttle. Played some more walking threes with Leon and Jarred. Picked up our Hum textbooks from the seminary coop. Talked with Evgenia about Greek at dinner. Got to know Sophia Emy. Roko's Basilisk. Went back to ihouse for tea in Zofie’s room. Conceptions of home. Reynold’s Club. Cheesies Grilled Cheeses. Went to our first frat party. Fiji. The stench of alcohol and sweat. Saw Exeter, Aren Mizuno. Ran into Megan Cui. Danced it out and handled ourselves responsibly. Stay dry. Think we’re setting into the rhythm of things. We’ve met some really cool people. Frisbee tomorrow. Figure out how to get to the Art Institute.

Memento: Choose to live a meaningful life. Start with a podcast. Set a table on the quad and talk to people. Our path to making it big. The next Carl Sagan, the next Homer.

Doctrine: On Nostalgia. *Nostos algos*, home pain. The past is the home for which we feel nostalgic. And though we may never return to that home, the past we carry always.
