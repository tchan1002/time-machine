Had a dream about going to a family gathering through a painting. Holocene extinction. Trial of the Chicago 7, is that not one of the best intros? Boba Fett is alive. Cato the Younger, the first filibuster. Epicus Maximus. Got a christmas card from Lekha. What if we studied advertising? Jimmy Mcgill. All for mammon. The art of rhetoric. English major? Neuroeconomics. Cornel West. Panegyric. Knowledge and Goodness. Went out for an easy 4, felt good. It kid-orgy metaphor for adulthood? Famous antisemites? Miles Gloriosus. Haberdasheries. Paean. Big words to show off your intelligence. This one goes out to Doyoung Kim. Sir Gawain indeed. Gotta put some focus on Greek and Math.
