Early in the morning we set out. Grabbed breakfast with Emily Curran. Caught up with JD. We’re done in an hour. Little puddles outside Stuart. Finished our investments mock final in the basement before we took on the real thing. Did we clutch up? 安河桥北. Where we at? Went down to Chinatown. Called Aboo. 墨西哥包, 小也要做老闆. Did laundry and watched altered carbon. 

We’re done. Take a little nap \+ some good food tonight before we start grinding again.   
Figure out this summer. Nothing of prestige, Francisco of Asissi.   
Earnestly we prostrate ourselves before the victorious conqueror.

Do laundry \+ pack.
