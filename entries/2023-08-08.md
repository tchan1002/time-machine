Day 31  
Woke up early and took the train out to Sunny Bay. Boarded a bus to Macau at the HZMB port. Caught up on some sleep before we arrived in Macau. Found the Macau Volunteers Association. Loaded up food-stuffs at a downstairs supermarket. Packed bags. Had some beef tendon noodles for lunch at a local food court. Laura from AVSM drove us to visit a home for the blind. Place is really nice. Laura told us about dog racing—canidromes. Checked into the Happy Family Hotel. Napped before we left to visit the ruins of St. Paul. The blue night\! The Fortaleza do Monte. Colonial architecture, mesh of past and future. A building resembling Howl’s moving castle—as if something living. Took a bus to the Venetian. Wide streets reminiscent of Shanghai. Had hotpot at a Haidilao. Got the zoomies. Returned to our hotel around midnight. Had a really good talk with Olger. We took some good photos today. Showered and slept. 

A man on the train next to us had 4 split screens across two phones running pokemon go.
