Chloe’s birthday. Eid Mubarak. Zyrtec. Big writing day. Go work in the newsroom. Finish the Dawn first. Wuthering Heights. Chiltern Classics. Eid lunch was tremendous. Pineapple Tamarind. Read the egg. Andy Weir wrote the egg? Switching to the second person. Newsroom. Translating thought onto paper. 2:00 PM already. We’ve got a complete draft of the Dawn. Fill and edit. Paid another visit to the health center for our lost Zyrtec. A really sunny day. Ran into Jacqueline and Lara. Went to Bancroft. Played Connect Four. Acquired a copy of the Aeneid. Laurel wreath, flower crown. Visited the Water Street Bookstore. Communal journals. Housing forms out for Chicago. Get them in before July 1st. Beviaries and bestiaries. Lobster poetry. Get everything put in shape by tomorrow. Talk to Myers about The Dawn V2. Ran for the first time in a while. Did some pull-ups. Felt good. Really missed it. Called Chloe. Call Aboo tomorrow. Rad stardust in the morning. Memorise our Ted talk.
