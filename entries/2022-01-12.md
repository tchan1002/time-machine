Might get out tomorrow. Kaitlyn’s birthday today. We'll see how we did on our Greek test. Pack our things, get ready for departure. Miller-Urey Genesis. Wubba lubba dub dub. Remember why. Wake up. Get back on the log. Showered. Crywank the Band. The Chicago Review. Tiare Tahiti by Rupert Brooke. Acts 16:26

“For the good is even better when it is hard.”

Breath and death, womb and tomb.  
“Shallow shadow, grave and grave.”
