#### Must Do's
- [x] Laundry
- [x] CC writeup

In lieu of a thesis. Massive lists. Woke up feeling good. Into the storm. Chicago pope, hyde park pope? Lunch with Kublai, friends are few and far between. Train ourselves to write quickly. Put stuff out. CC writeup finished in 20. Ate with Brother Annio/Spencer, who we may have met three years ago at Lafayette NJCL. Did laundry. Summer already, past april. Finished invisible cities. The prize for our trudge through the years is a greater understanding of the self. Stop wishing.

Free nevin hall school walkout.
The smartest man we knew for many years was a catholic—Stephen McNulty.

Think of the books we enjoyed—Gatsby. The good ones really stuck the landing, become unforgettable. Our longstanding theory: ferris bueller's day off is a catcher in the rye. 

1 run makes us feel so good.
