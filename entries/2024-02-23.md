Grabbed brunch with Sophia. Had a horchata at Hallowed. Went back to North and napped. Walked up to CVS to pick up our cream. Had some awesome butternut squash at Bart. Decided to ditch the writer’s conference to go see A24’s Problemista. Caught up with Clancy on our way down to Ida Noyes. Blizzard as we left the theater. Ran back for our first set of RA interviews. Clean up\! Do homework so we’re up on next week.
