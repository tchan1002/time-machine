Shoddy sleep last night. Couldn't quit thinking about schwarzman. Have our spiel down though. Woke up at 5. Checked in. Walked past a family saying goodbye to their kid. All dressed so beautifully, especially the father with his black songkok and his white vestments. Rubbing away a tear from his eye. The mother in purple—then the brothers all in their finest. If we had our camera out. Lounge. Showered. breakfast. Landed in Hong Kong. Played around with Chat. Landed in Beijing.

I'm excited to be here at schwarzman because this is exactly the sort of place where I can do what I do best, bringing amazing entrepreneurs together to realize exciting possibilities.
