Woke up to snow, went to breakfast. A light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it. Books from Dr. Wooley. Basement next Wednesday at lunch. Twelfth night tonight. H H Holmes. Twelfth Night was massive. Ran into Newbould on the tuba. Went to prep rally. Visited Bancroft with Amber and Indigo. Alpargatas. Thereâ€™s a cyrano movie.
