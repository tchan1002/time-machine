Got dressed. Raspberries at breakfast. Done with finals. Banging. Use our next couple of days wisely. Draft coolcat. Watched bullet train. Erstwhile in a dark forest. Finished our 糖醋排骨. Craving cucumber sandwiches. Views of Mount Fuji. Threaded our hoodie as we watched Bullet Train. Lore of the Tentoumushi. Stocked up on some snacks from the homeroom. Visited Rishi’s room. A new Indiana Jones movie. One man’s quest to spiritual awakening. 

Snippet: 50s hotel. Beige diamond-backed floor. Been thinking again about how much right we have to the past. *By the slight stubble on your chin.* White Winter Hymnal, as if jolted from some long sleep.

Coolcat: Done with our finals today, so our first term of college is at an end. Have taken a long break from here and feel eager to return—hoping to jog something lost. Thinking is living. Going home in a couple days and am excited. 

Song: Good Morning by the Bleachers.
