Day 42  
Went out to Wong Tai Sin in the morning. Delivered fortune bags to old people’s houses. Pasta for lunch. Came back midday, tired. Sat on the floor of the mtr station. Slept when we got home. Cling onto life. Went out to Nam Cheong. Olger, we’re in a fight for our soul. Cut ourselves some slack but keep writing. 

Brass Spoon, Central. Russell’s recommendation.   
To be All American. Out of the Northeast into the steel mills of East Chicago.

Song: East Chicago, Indiana by Michigander.
