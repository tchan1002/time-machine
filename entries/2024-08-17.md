**Day 36**  
A month out from school. Slow day, packed up our stuff. A little breather. Follow Will Park on spotify. Sat in Union Park. Grabbed a chair for an old Asian couple with their dog QQ, a black pug who sniffed our fingers and rolled around belly up. “He likes to show off”. Sunshower as we typed this out. Went back to the hostel to make noodles. Met Eden from Australia, who also takes pictures. Took the F streetcar to meet Annalisa at the Musee Mecanique. Foggy and now a light mist, like out of one of those very fine sprinklers at a summer garden. Sat down, talked, and had a vanilla steamer at some cafe. Told Annalisa about Siddartha summer. Will Park picked us up from Walgreens. Beach digging, fire building. Clark called Clara, and watched us dig the pit. Sebastian, Alexis, Chloe, Ben, Kavya, Will Park, Clara, and Annalisa. Sunset over the ocean “just as it's supposed to be.” *which is weird because no one’s ever seen that.* Three Californian teens in the car.

About the bone broth, and yoga, and the cafe, and David who went to Japan to study bone broth for three years. And this interconnected web. *If this isn’t nice, what is.* 

Anya Taylor Joy. End scene of Emma, *I think about that all the time.* 

“David gave me recs for wine because he heard I was going to Sonoma county, I had no heart to tell him that I was 18 and did not drink”

Overheard: “It’s just a second, Holden”  
“When you’re thirty five and you have these pictures, you will be so happy”
