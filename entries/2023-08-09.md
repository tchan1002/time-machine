Day 30  
Woke up at 8:00. Brushed our teeth. Grabbed some buns from the Circle K across the street. Checked out of our hotel. Delivered food bags to the elderly at Fatima’s Church. Revisited the Venetian for artificial skies. Had a Portuguese tart before we left Macau. Tired. Returned to Hong Kong in the afternoon. Patched up entries. Rest and reset. Work out, buff up our shoulders. Did pushups.

Get some sleeveless shirts and white socks  
Pair of wide cut jeans?  
Black puffer jacket. 

Meta:  30 days left to go. This summer has been tough. Doesn’t feel like we’ve done much, but we’ve made connections with people, we’ve done good work, we know we can survive now. Take ourselves day by day.
