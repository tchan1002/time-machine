Two days now, leaving at 7, we have caught the Italian military men walking down the street in black berets, camo outfits tucked into black boots. High stone walls of the Vatican. Two thinkers over the protruding marble gate. The God Bes. Trip to the Ecumenical Council, 1972\. They really put everything in the Vatican. In the Sistine Chapel, *silencio silencio, no taking pictures, no talking*. 

ΠΛΕΙΣΤΟΙ ΑΝΘΡΩΠΟΙ ΚΑΚΟΙ.
