Day 82  
Momâ€™s out of quarantine. Grabbed dim sum with the family. Took the bus down to Tsim Sha Tsui. Olger lost his phone last night at LKF. Called the police at Chungking Mansion. Indian food, some sort of Tatooine. Rode in a cop car. Bonded with Ashley as we were waiting for Olger at the Tsim Sha Tsui police station. Grabbed dinner with Angela. Felt some sort of closure to confess about Jacqueline and how much that meant to us. Walked around in the dark. Caught us in some sad boi hours. The arc of this summer, some sort of familial redemption. About escaping infantilization, the recognition from our parents of who we are as an individual. Someone playing Stand By Me on the train again. This is water, this is water, we will live. Wong Kar Wai, this city.
