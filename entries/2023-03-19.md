Flying back to Chicago. Haunting of Hill House. Emailed Seraphina about taking our math final this week. Survivor Chicago, the game is afoot. Arrived at Bradley. Three hours until we lift off. Rotating orange fenced radar under the purple rolling clouds. Met Zayd and shared a lyft back to campus. Did some cleaning. Slept.

In good bithynia, I saw you last.  
Full fathom five thy father lies.  
What rough beast slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
