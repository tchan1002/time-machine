Wrapped our grapes in a blanket. Ran into a reporter with a mic by Cobb gate. Started talking to us about affirmative action. We thought we were going to get canceled. Had lunch at Baker. Plantains. Settled in the A level next to Tom. Thought of the flan we had at Berkeley. Death awareness in Apes. Take cool classes. Signed wopo balls. Ran into the mock at Cobb gate. Followed them to the point. Dipped our toes in Lake Michigan. Grabbed fourth meal at Baker. Sat down with Ali and Carter. Ran into Tae at Tiffins. Sat down with Tae and Anuj. Had a nice convo, we’ve come so far. 

Lensing stars, Jupiter’s moons.  
The fault not in our stars.   
Chicken and rabbits, 雞兔同籠.
