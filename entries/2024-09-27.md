Day with Holden. Met him at the Art Institute. Frederick Edwin Church’s View of Cotopaxi, a glimpse of paradise. Too bad they didn’t have cameras. Erm, *what the bao pi?* 卫世人. Called Rishi. Called J Money. Katapugon. Slept. Reynolds night shift. Talked with Crisbelle about perfumes. “...like writing a letter.” We’re really good at getting in there. Left at 12:30. Honey please come home. Stayed up to watch a cooking show. Caved and had eggs. 

In the best conversations, names don’t come up until you’re way way in. And maybe that reflects the mindset required in the best conversations. Forget structure.

Just film something.
