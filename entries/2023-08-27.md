Day 12  
Woke up. Left at 10:00 to go meet Joy. Noticed a man’s shoes on the train—white with paint specks like a Jackson Pollock. Met Joy at Pacific Place. Had bibimbap at a Korean restaurant. Walked over to the exhibition center. Cat Expo\! An experience for sure. Norwegian forest cats. Got really tired. Had dumplings for dinner with Joy. Walked her back near her place. Went home. Bittermelon soup. 

Dreamt of two flying tardigrades with mouths of fire. Like clouds descended they became buses of apocalypse. Dreams have been vivid enough for us to think that perhaps living is an exercise of training images for the everlasting dream (death).
