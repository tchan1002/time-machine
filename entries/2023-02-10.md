Headed to Baker for breakfast. Rehearsed with Bill. Showtime, downed a bottle of gatorade for Thyestes. *What is this agitation that roils my intestines?* Had lunch with Val at Bart. Returned to IHouse. Canyon Moon. Karaoke in the bathroom. Logged onto our writing seminar. Aphra Behn. A room of one’s own. Submitted our Mock stack survey. Talked to Aidan en route to the midway ice rink. Aymane, a savage on the ice. Had dinner with Zofie and Sophia. Went to Henry’s room in BJ then Juli’s apartment. Sent Isabella off to her uber. Pulled up to Alpha Delt with Mock Trial. Ended up staying up in Jack’s room in South with Tae. Lifted back at 2:00. Feverish night. 

The body informs thought.
