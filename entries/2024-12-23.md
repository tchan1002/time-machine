When in doubt, read or run.  
Don't let thinking kill doing.

A THEORY WE HAVE:
*"the difference between a million and a billion is a billion"*
why are people good at conventional dimensions of achievement (e.g school) more likely to succeed at x? not necessarily because cdoa is related to x, but because people who excel in cdoa have skills that apply to x.
what does this means for us as a non-cdoa? we're always one swing away at x, but we do need to acquire effort/persistence/cdoa-ness to get to bat.
