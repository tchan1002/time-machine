Day 81  
Rest in peace Technoblade. Cook rice. Go out for vegetables and groceries today at 4:00. Kimchi. Head out to run before Kirtland. Cooked rice. Supreme meat and eggs. Browsed through some photos from Joy on dropbox. Rennet. Livin on a prayer. Keep the water cycle going. Cig. Blades of Glory. Black Letters. Aphantasia. Protocols to communicate a matter of fundamental perspective. Charcoal and Madness. Head down to the New Haven beach sometime. Went to Kirtland. Fibbage. Go get some polymer clay. Behemoth for two.
