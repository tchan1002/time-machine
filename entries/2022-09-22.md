Cleaned up our room and installed our alarm clock. Get into the regular swing of things. A world for us to conquer. Had breakfast with Louis. Went to our academic advising meeting. Did a scavenger hunt at the OI with Dellara and Saul. Pazuzu. Won a mug. Had a career advising group session with all Classics kids. Lauren from New Haven. Aims of Education. Meaning predicated upon the existence of future generations. Eudaimonia. Went out to the Logan center. Danced. Walked back with Gian. Hung out in the lounge with Chris and people. Read Timequake, Kurt Vonnegut. Showered and got locked out of our room. Return Nelsonâ€™s shirt to Celina. Abstain from Dairy. Stay loose, make moves. Classes coming up soon.
