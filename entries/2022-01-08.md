Woke up and brushed our teeth. Went back to sleep some more. Living in stasis here. Get well-rested and focus on what we want to do. Remember why. Feeling better with our cough too. Bucolic. Spanier’s down. Bully Maguire. Minced Oaths. Mindhorn. Let’s watch Murder Mystery. Shaved. People playing a game of hockey downstairs. Poppycock. The Great Vowel Shift. Need to start keeping a list of people we know at UChicago. Dean Weatherspoon really sent all that from his iphone.

Reality is compromised.  
“Not just a red flag, a whole Soviet parade.”
