Day 6  
Went down to New Haven to get our Mac checked. Sat at the public library and read Reading Greek. Met mom at a very nice Korean restaurant. Looked into the history of the Chicago core. A tale of two curricula. St. John’s college. Moot court. Pontic infinitives. The End of the F’ing World. Not a lot of days left. Some tortured fantasy. Strive to be inspired again.
