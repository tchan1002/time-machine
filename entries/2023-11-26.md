Showered and packed our things. Tachyons. *Ludus calamari.* Sent Chloe down to the train station. Land of the Lostâ€”what an actually beautiful film. Chicago from the Sufjan Stevens album. Came home for an hour with mom before heading back to the airport. Archie dropped us off. Ran into Anderson at the gate. Lots of familiar acquaintances on the plane. Valbs and Zayd. The story of how four men found Muhammed. Got back to our room. Made some congee. Slept. 

What we chronicle. An extra hour with our mom. Movie dialogues. The little bits of mundane. This little pocket of air. We will live. We will live.
