Day 28  
Zoomed Ethan Donovan in the morning. Went out to Dim Sum with Dad. Dirk Gently. Went back home and napped. Left for volunteering. Aaron. Met up with Andrew and Lucy at the IFC. Grabbed dinner with them, Aabir and JD in Sheung Wan. Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. We were shook. Flash of light, crack of the heavens. Missed the last train home. Exited the station at Admiralty. Walked along the harbourfront trying to catch a cab. Absolutely no one out except a couple smooching by the railing. The empty streets, surreal. He Doesn’t Know Why by the Fleet Foxes. Took a taxi home, slept. 

Doctrine: The inconvenience of carrying a camera makes a photographer intentional. To be “on the hunt” for a photo.

At Trinity, they said with eyes closed they could still see the bones in their hands. 

Song: He Doesn’t Know Why by the Fleet Foxes.
