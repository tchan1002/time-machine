Get approved and resume wrestling. Get back up. Did alright on the Greek test but we can do better. Biked for 35 minutes and got approved for practice tomorrow. Rhyme time. Roam tomes. Wherefore I have found this new mirth I do not know. Took a big nap today. Add drop ends Friday. Had eight eggs. Did the dishes. We really looked at marketing to write our essays. Meeting with Sabrina tomorrow at 3:00. Don’t forget. Buy groceries tomorrow. They will write our name across the stars. We’ve found friends though. StuCo. 

We’re just letting time past by lately. Get back on it.
