Day 20  
Called Dad. Think transfer plans are a no. Our first 4.0. Spent a good couple hours on coding. Isabellaâ€™s back on our Mock team. Went out for a three miler. The air crisp like a knife. Ran on the track. *Montezuma.* Watched Rick and Morty. Freddie Mercury. Ask Gabby out to the movies? Finished our fama-french three factor replication. Talked to Sam. 

If in three years we are put in stasis, live as best as we can. Know that we tried.
