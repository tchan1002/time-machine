Out. Wonderwall. Did laundry. Ate and played quadball with Franklin. Re-integrating ourselves back into society. Eta into amoguses. The infinity amogus. Hamartia. Sat in the sun with Lara, Peyton and Indigo. Ate fries. Collected our laundry. Finish Miranda before meeting tomorrow at 12:30. Origami Insects II. Stumbled upon the OMA dinner at Weth with Harry. Went to Shantelleâ€™s performance. Put quotes in and spin. Goodpain. Felt sad about the end of the school year. Have to go out and run. The nights are beautiful. Talk to Jacqueline. Feeling unhinged. Fugue state.

Watched the sky in the Bowld as Shantelle sang. The lyrics freed from chains of meaning as they swelled into song. 

Song: Cold cold man by Saint Motel. Wonderwall by Oasis. Goodpain by Yoke Lore.
