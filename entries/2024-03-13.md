Woke up at 6\. Showered before grabbing breakfast. The probiotic strat. Santander. Lunch on a patio. Had a great time talking with Sofia and Nico from digital keeper. Grabbed their instagrams. Visited Bimbo’s bread factory. Showered at the hotel before heading out for the evening. Walked with the group to a vintage store in Condesa. Had tacos. Met the rest of the group at Cafe de Nadie. Francisco’s scorpion mezcal. A run-in with cops. Salsa’d. Gabriel Daudy\! Midnight oxxo with Anthony, Carlos and Valeria. Montezuma’s revenge.
