Day 68  
Felt the sunburn when we woke up. Went to Tsing Yi to grab Chloe’s debit card from 二姑媽. Had breakfast. 二姑媽 gave us some substantial pocket money. Kowloon Elemental. Bought tickets for spidey. Shook. Needed some time to adjust back to a non-animated reality. Characters fleshed out well. Had hot pot with Angie, Minseo and Jolie. Took the mtr back home. Not a lot of time to R2A. Slept. Revisited past entries. Pick up our documents tomorrow and realign ourselves with our goals. Check out Nhan’s work for a model of what we can do for the rest of this summer. 

Think we prefer Repulse Bay to Shek O’s beach. The steep drop into water is nice, and the platforms are fun to swim to. The past couple of weeks living in Hong Kong. Participating in the rhythm of the city. MTR. Work has been goofy. Make sketches of places. 

Comparing last summer to this summer. Last summer was about imagination, this summer is about reality. Reconciling the two, and learning how to breathe in real thick water. Might have started this summer wrong by choosing to watch the Batman on the plane. Too much of a vengeance.
