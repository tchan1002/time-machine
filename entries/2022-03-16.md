Go see American Gothic. The farmer’s daughter. Criselda Vasquez. Cemetery Gates. The Smiths. Went out to Costco with mom and Chloe. L’art pour l’art. Don’t take language merely to be a medium, and don’t shy away from violence. Picked up a great copy of Pillars of the Earth. The Five People You Meet in Heaven.
