Did our laundry. Taxi Driver on docfilms. Met up with Minseo and Rodrigo at the Study, some Exeter event. Sat on the quad with them, took some pictures. Played bucket hat frisbee with Rodrigo. Ran into Josie and Evgenia outside Bartlett as we were walking back to North. Had a very cool convo with Evgenia on the A level about RSOs and the Grey City. The 64th Folk Fest. Walked around putting up posters for Crew with Josie, Evgenia and Moran. Had dinner with Sam at Woodlawn. Some first years from Max P sat down with us. Met Laurel. Gave our spiel about finance and consulting, *all copium*. Walked around with Sam. Submitted Booth course requests. Grey city gonzo journalism, swimmers at the point. IOP coverage. 

Visual artists, graphic designers, photographers, filmmakers, musicians—there’s definitely an artistic network here. Across all the RSOs. Reach out to Logan.
