Alligator Sky. We’re back. Walked to Bart in the rain. Had lunch with Alex and Leah. Dropped a coolcat. D-Nik\! Leaving the red dust behind, *for dust you are, and to dust you shall return.* Settled in the stacks of the reg. Caught up with Damien on the second floor of the reg. Outer banks. Read more of Vonnegut. Got dressed. Met Sophia down at Tiffins. Lyfted to the alumni event. Caught up with Norton. Odd odd moment. Adam Tuchler’s tie. Met Lucy Garberg’s boyfriend Daniel, who’s a med student. Went to Five Guys with Lucy, Daniel, Richard, DIana and Sophia. Had fries. Snuck in the backdoor of Jimmy’s. Erin and Oia, Luke and Eric from Blue Chips. Lyfted back home and went to bed. 

*Found your mom’s instagram.* 

Coolcat: Had a premonition (?) that Ash Wednesday was coming a couple weeks ago. Really feeling it this year. Some recent updates: We are applying to be an RA. Just received a couple interviews from houses, and we really need them to come through. Article on Moby Dick is out. Thankful for the duck that Marcus left us the past week. We miss Hong Kong Style Diners. The fourth-years on our hallway. Glad we talked to Thomas O'Shea.
