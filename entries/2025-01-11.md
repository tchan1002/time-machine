Skated over to Kent. If stranded on the dark side: find moon-raft. Left for Moda. Set up lights. Maryam's our resident. Didn't end up eating until dinner. A couple first years found Warrick briefly unconscious on the 9th floor just as we were about to head out. Recapped Joe and Cristi on what happened.
