Slept in. Showered. Went to our 10:30 discussion. Talked to Nish after class about why he left his consulting job for a philosophy phd. Black coat, glasses, Morpheus. Someone we could talk to. Darrel Cha. Met Yona at Quantum. Matteo and Yeap. Back sore which is good. Called JF; play to win. Quit our lab this week. Did laundry. Compartmentalize. "What a piece of work is a man."  Two bananas and a cup of tea. Went down to the study. AI Safety conference. Schools represented, Berkeley, UBC. Perhaps odd to be in a room of college students who think we're on a 3 to 5 year track to apocalypse. Stayed and talked with Julian (UChicago) and (Atarva) Brown. Prune excess activities. Today was exceedingly warm. Afternoon sun.

Our thoughts on AI: implementation vs innovation. we are less worried about AGI/ASI threats due more than how existing AI will influence human behavior towards world-ending scenaros (AI weaponization, development of bioweapons, etc...) We believe that the next stage in AI model development are economically feasible small language models trained on human expert knowledge, e.g in cancer screening or air traffic control. Projections: 3-5 years human expert knowledge, 50-100 years human personal knowledge. Change-makers will be the ones who own human data/or can elicit it through monopoly over interfaces. 

Thesis of TGAT: Though we have tried to conquer the expanse, we have not conquered its wilderness. That wilderness now presents within us as urban existential angst. Chicago, affront against heaven, city of the human spirit.
