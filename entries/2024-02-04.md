Take Jacob’s poem as our creed.

Exhausted our body. Fell into a deep sleep and dreamt that we were in Australia—a fictitious Sydney. We rode a train elevated above the harbor between the two parts of the city, both industrial. The sun fell and we went home. Bird’s eye view, we saw ourselves walking up an isthmus flanked by bioluminescent reefs. We were struggling to train more images—we were worried about not being ready. 

Bring film to Mexico.  
Go full on micro, we can catch up on investments later.
