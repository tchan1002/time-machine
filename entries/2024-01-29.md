Grabbed a Bartlett brunch. Went to investments. Bianca introduced us to Tweek. Get in on productivity apps—or really just a calendar. Went down to Logan and returned our speedlight. Ate at Cathey with Isaiah. Squirrels raiding a bird's nest. Talk productivity—do a series where we interview our friends and try out their schedules. Grabbed a quick bite at Baker with Claudia before taking a lyft down to Harper. Fukase’s crows. Attended a meeting of the glass eye. Went back up north and ate with Moran. Soul Man. Schedule our meals for this week. Plans for Gary Indiana this Sunday. Get our plans down for this summer. Back on tinder\! Our phone’s just blowing up. 

Gotta get out there, gotta reach out and talk to people. Can’t operate on a doom mindset. Winning breeds winning. Try growing our photo account.
