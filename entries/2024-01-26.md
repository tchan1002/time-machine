Woke up and showered. Grabbed hutch with Sophia. Moved to Ex Lib. Something about kids. Raining out. Went down to Logan to borrow a speedlight. Walked back up to the reg. *In the blue silver chromium diner*. Zofie and Giancarlo. Opened our first packs of film, 2 canisters of Kodak gold. Get to know Oliver Drazky on Bellie. Pulled up to the basement of Reynolds for our investment pset. Week saved. Got on the waitlist for Berlin and Mexico. Nap—grind out our work so we’re free tomorrow and Sunday. Midnight onions. Flatid Planthopper Nymphs.
