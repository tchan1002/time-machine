Woke up early. Took the red metrobus down to El Centro. Had breakfast at a local diner, some Huevos Rancheros. Hopped on a bus for the pyramids. Barrios on the outskirts of the city. Las Montagnes. Had some pulque made from agave. Spent our day out among the rocks and nopal. Snacked on a piece of bread. Got super tired on our way back. Rested for a bit at a starbucks and recharged. Had dinner at Taqueria Orinoco. A- on micro we’ll take it. Two layers of sunscreen and we still got burnt. 

*The temple of the sun and moon are oriented towards the pleiades/ in colombia in veracruz in bolivia there is a mountain with the face of a man/ his thumb points up at those stars and they think it’s where we come from/ in the year 1590, montezuma confused cortes for god. brought silver and gold to meet him/ butterfly, in spanish we say mariposa, in indian language we say papalote.*

Meta: The goal of our short lived *getting comfortable* series was threefold—get comfortable with how we look on camera \+ get in the habit of posting \+ learn to tell engaging stories. Maybe our best path forwards is to figure out good content and go from there. We don’t want to make content, we want to make art.

Memento: Have to get away from these neurodivergent tattooed bisexual asian/wasians\!\!\! They are not good for us\!\!\!
