Woke up feeling a bit tired but we went to have breakfast. Rushed to finish a rough draft of the reverse PCR diagram during Department Meeting. Fatiguing today to catch some rest. Cried about Grace. Get back up now. Ran to grab food. Got some grill cookies and sat shortly with Sophie in the music building on the way back. Came awfully close in Wordle: Light. Won the fifty fifty. Potential triple sleep-in tomorrow. Friends, Nicaraguans, Countrymen. Talked with Amber about Hippos. Turned today around. We’re doing good. Go to bed now.
