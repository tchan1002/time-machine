Made the choice to wake up today. Stopped by ISAC to work. Attention and HW Pset in. Took pictures for UCSP. Stopped by Hutch. Brass band was playing, we put some beads on and dug into our shrimp and jambalaya. Felt positively awful. Went back and completely broke down. A little projector screen playing in our head of everything that we'd missed. It was Motion Sickness, it was White Ferrari by Frank Ocean. 80 pu. Film a video for ourselves.

I worry that we're not having a very good time/ peeked through what we were writing about last year/ some things we made good on, some things we didn't/ have we come out wiser? / april come she will / stop pussying out/ what should drive us? / hate weakness.

we're on a dangerous track to losing big / we are genial but have no close ties / no friends of routine / look back at our last two years of exeter / what do we do now / late in life mom and dad are making friends / always time to turn around and have a jolly good time / maybe its getting an apartment with friends / need to map this out / moving to indonesia would really be leaving everything behind / ditch this loser perspective / make the plays

Drink the devil water. Cf dune. It's committing to utmost vulnerability that breaks barriers.

Dreams of storm king art center. Think someone once shared this dream with us?

Song: White Ferrari by Frank Ocean.
