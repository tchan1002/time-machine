Day 14  
Andrew left in the morning. Slept in. Grabbed breakfast downstairs. Congee with Sambal. Checked out. Updated our LinkedIn. Went with Yeap to meet Warren at Newton Food Market. Brotherly behaviour. Warren got us some Hainanese chicken rice and sugar cane juice. Descended into the MRT. Went on a solo adventure. Telok Ayer. The Singapore city gallery.   
Didn’t know that the Marina Bay was reclaimed land. Rushed back to the hotel. Took a grab car to Changi. Listened through *Cigarettes after Sex* on the plane. Fell asleep halfway into Guardians of the Galaxy. Hong Kong, back home. Got on the E23 bus. Four day spread, reconstruct entries. Two weeks to Chicago. Figure out add drop. Shower and get some sleep.

Snippet: Talked to Yeap about Mock. Goofy goofy activity. But the idea of perfection, obsession at the highest level. Gestures scripted, practiced, executed. Down to the miniscule. It’s when the first mouth opens, about “winning the room”. Making the practiced seem natural. That’s who we have to be.
