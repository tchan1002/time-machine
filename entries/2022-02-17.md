In the morning haze, you became a fleeting shade. Pseudacris Crucifer by Terrance Hayes. Cursed Shade. Terza Rima. The fourth hour of the night. Exhume my heart. A quiet acquiescence. Nasubi. The fall of stuco. Four browning men. Mock trial. Ode to the West Wind.

“Cleave themselves into chasms, while far below  
The sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wear  
The sapless foliage of the ocean, know.”
