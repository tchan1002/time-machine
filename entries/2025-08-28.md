#### Must Do's
- [x] Go run
- [x] Cursor 5 dollar deal
- [x] [[No Leftovers]]

Sleeping early was the right move. We’re up and out at 8 to go up to shenzhen with aboo. We look fuller and much more well rested. Tribute to mishima. Cursor free trial. It's a good sign that we're running into YC backed tools to use—means we’re ahead of the curve/early adopter. We still have $5 in api credits in Chat. Slow down and spend good time with aboo and gonggong. Those are going to be the times we miss. Bakso urat 👍 牛丸河。If we want to get into hardware—get ourselves some nfc tags to play with. Duplicate student IDs + create membership cards for [[+1]] Club. Mocked up a linkedin post for [[Big Indo]]. Nice two day rest. Prep jyutping for first product hunt launch.

- Once you see how the sausage is made, you have way less respect for all the chat wrappers making millions.
- Don’t build something that chatgpt is going to takeover with an update.
- This year, we rise above sustenance so that we can pursue abundance (at ages 23,24,25.) by 26 we want to be truly working on fidelity “westworld”, the soul and stuff—meld consciousness
- Our two currencies to achieving anything is time and people.

Year long arc: 
- Micro tool reputation building “our first $5” (September)
- B2B saas for UChicago HRL (what we know, what we can build, what people don’t realize is worth doing)
- Z-fellows? (June/July/August 2026)
- See where we go from there: enough seed money and rep to launch a life in New York

[[Webapp Ideas]]: Better Avatars. Create cute virtual avatar creatures for AI models to inhabit as a user interface // Kiki bouba-sound to shape // Playpen: allow user to draw their creature, talk to it—then all the creatures interact in a sandbox. // See draw your fish.

[[Substack]] The gift of hindsight. Relate Will Hu’s life thesis and Oliver Drazsky’s anchor. We want to be judged not by our status but by our hunger. AI is the greatest democratization of our time. A kid with a computer can build something for anyone with 5 bucks. Our vision from assisi—second year francis came to tell us in our fever to hollow ourselves out, break bread with strangers. The next summer in the South basement pushing linens around radicalized us. That tremendous waste. Machiavelli on Savonarola—“the armed prophet makes change”

[[Substack]] What we learned from Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs is that a company is not its products or idea, but people. See how Jobs pulled top talent into his team and had that talent follow him around. We need a group of people who are really innovative, hungry, and willing to go all night. 

[[Substack]]: Plato's allegory of the cave. If technology is about reducing the barriers of representing ideas in reality, see writing -> painting -> photography, it's a question of how rich the mindworld is when the mind-world veil weans >> Hayy Ibn Tufayl. Adapt the message so you don't scare people away. You're looking for a certain type of person (narrow is the gate), but that type of person is not a type of being, but a type of action. (A builder is not born a builder, a builder is a builder by building.)

[[Substack]] Hacking the mind. in attention and working memory, we learned you can really hold one thing in memory at a time. your working memory capacity is the greatest predictor of success—the real life top gun. kurtzegasatz video on the present being an illusion. we’re great with the long term planning but we’re shit at the short term execution that’s going to get us there. the former is creative while the latter is systematic. solution? outsource that to a machine. Nick Kovalsky taught us to look at processes, look at them like games, that’s how we level up with compounding growth.

[[Substack]] There are these moments that change your perspective and you keep going back to them. We hadn’t seen our dad in two years when he picked us up at Shenzhen. At nanchang, he showed us the product of our generational jump (it was one swim across the river) >> The Aeneas myth. The one qualifier for Aeneas is that he is pious. Pius Aeneas dan (et :)) fidus achates. >> Of course there’s nothing in common I have with these people. It’s the stories that mend us into one family

We’ve got to scale up with the things we build. Actionable insights will be a system not just an app. If we do word games we need to advertise them and make them social.

What we learned from jyutping—it’s lowkey not about technicals at all. People are gonna respond to something emotional even if it’s just mocked up in 2 hours.

For the past week, we’ve been locked in the moment we wake up. Whys that? We’ve probably always had the want or hunger to become better, but how are we carrying forward this momentum? Biotriggers: we get out of bed right away and pack up our cot so we can’t go back to sleep. Brush our teeth and we start thinking. We did check our phone for project updates so maybe we’re being prompted by what we leave yesterday.

[[Big Ticket]] Data privacy. How can we give AI access to all of your info so that you can use your tools, while preventing AI from storing your data?
