Morning train to Porto. Checked into Rivoli Theater Hostel. Played Monkey Type. Pork buns for lunch. Walked around town. Porto solos. Blue tiled churches. Had a really nice brownie/icecream at Garden, a brunch place. Ran into Joseph Mooney across the street. Afternoon tour. Porto's train station was built atop a convent—the city waited 60 years for its last nun to die. Had dinner at a pretty nice place.

Song: Something by the Beatles. Beautiful Boy by John Lennon.

portuguese vineyards
an outstretched field
furrowed
the hills in the distance
rendered blue in the twilight 

20 miles of sunless sea 
outstretch the moor and me

green curtains
lights fluorescent translucent
like a 60s diner

our entries are a zip file
lossful compression? but possibly reconstructed 

the forms our minds engender/wrap us in silly benders

creative flow
basquiat’s speed
it is what one does when what isn’t painting 
perhaps an argument for ayahuasca 
a sort of word vomit

idea generation and culling are distinct processes
“get an interesting person very drunk"

writing is the only “after the effect” method of recording

rivoli theater hostel
metropolis fritz lang
woman in the moon
track time between sci-fi and realization of those concepts

boredom is good 
it gets us thinking
wiki and books app is all we need for scrolling
fight fragmentation

cities rendered museums, fitting end for the empires of europe
