Heed the cry of Marsyas. Oscar Wilde and the little bit of Jesus in him. My certified lover, have this badge of my love. The salt of the earth. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. The spectator of one’s own tragedy. Finished De Profundis. Had dinner with Will and Hansi. Watched 5 centimeters per second with Shalom.

“In the valley of kings  
Of far off egypt  
There lays the tomb of a king  
Long since forgotten.” 

“She will hang the night with stars so that I may walk abroad in the darkness without stumbling”
