**Day 83**  
Slept in, showered. No repercussions. Outside the window of our office, some girl pacing around in jorts and a green top. Played disc golf. Reclaimed the bananas we left on the windowsill. Pepto-abysmal. Bean soup for lunch. Cleaned up our room. Decluttered to free up more space. Grabbed dinner with Cole. Ran to the point with Nolan and Juli. Lanterns. Ghostlight. Lovetap. Smores. Stayed up late playing poker. 

Turned the mirror away from us. What are we building?  
Depressing as hell\!
