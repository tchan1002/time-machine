Papaya and milk for breakfast. Alote. HSBC. Propaga, microfinancing Mexico’s corner store. Bees and honey. Extracting value is a game of finding pains. See startups as an avenue by which the world heals itself. Hotel lunch. Chicken in a tangy sauce, tortilla soup, and great cake. Showered. Went out with the group to Chinatown. Took an uber to Belen’s in Hidalgo. Found ourselves chatting with Guadelupe, the groundskeeper*.* Took an uber back. Hung out with the people in Simon’s room.
