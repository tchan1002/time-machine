Woke up. Hopped on a bus and went down to Chinatown for some Ming Hin. Had a good chat with Zane. Took the red back with Rina, Belen and Jackie. Rested a bit before heading to CSIL for Sliced Bread. Edited our photos for Briston Maroney. Went down to South. Alexa offered us some cuties and baby cheeses. Followed her to a lunar new year’s party at Solstice. Saw many of our friends. Went to Yuk Sum’s.
