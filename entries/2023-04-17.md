Slept way over. Claireâ€™s coming next year. Walked to the 59th street metra station. Stayed in the waiting room. A Japanese scene. Worked on our polisci essay on Rawls. Light snow, freezing again as we travelled downtown. Stones embedded on the walls of the tribune tower. Got ourselves some chocolate covered raisins. The AMC near Grand. Phone fixed. Took shelter in the Gleacher center. Took the shuttle back. Dinner at Woodlawn. Lifted back with Aidan. Slept.
