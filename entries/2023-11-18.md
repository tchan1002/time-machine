Slept in. Had gyozas with Chloe for brunch. Lobster dinner with mom. The cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Fixed our Riovaz article. Went out for a three miler. Trembling stars. Came back and showered. Flashes of light. Compile stuff tomorrow. Watch Uncut Gems. Why so many children in Gaza? Made eggs, had croissants. Snack before bed. 

Doctrine: A development on our theology. Light, the word, and flesh all encode informationâ€”they are creators of intelligence in the shapeless void and vehicles of the self. The flesh is the body we perceive each other. The word is the form of our consciousness. And light, that is the character of our soul, the origin of being, distinguished from consciousness as something more abstract, a feeling. 

Song: Grace by Axe and the Henchman.
