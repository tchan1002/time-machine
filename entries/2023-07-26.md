Day 44  
Feeling better. Suspect food poisoning. Need a little break from everything. How important it is to own a little piece of the sky—some space to breathe. Kafka on the shore. Sat outside on the balcony for a little. Another typhoon hitting this weekend? See if we want to go out for dinner. Went out to meet dad. Started getting a little dizzy as we were trying to find our way round Causeway Bay. Came back home. Had some herbal jelly. Drank water. Slept. Migraine. 

Feeling this frustration again?   
In the morning we became doves and flew.   
Cried as we looked into a child’s eyes. 

Doctrine: Let shame and guilt guide our moral rigidity. Because they supply the persistence to hold shape against the grey muck. Johanna D’Arc of Mongolia 1989, *they made signs to tame the wilderness*. So we took on the arbitrary, to reason out a moral system of living. to be something in this nothingness. 

In my subterranean journey, she came to me  
Dark and beautiful, wings outstretched  
My chthonic muse\! holding a pomegranate  
Red dripping from her lips.
