Grabbed a Baker breakfast. Slept in. Applied for a Lolla pass. All’s well on Berrypalooza. Went down south. Alex Banayan emailed. The world’s at Woodlawn. Good to see so many familiar faces. Languished a little after dinner. Smores and a firepit. The Human Instrumentality Project. 

Mother Mother’s Ghosting. Out of paralysis, we’ve regained movement. The *imperium sine fine* is an existentialist position. Sandcastles. We are loved\! We are loved\! Momentous summer.
