**Day 49**  
Figured out pre-reg. Signed up for App Dev, Marketing Management, Econometrics, and COGS 20001\. Left for the reg. Sat down with Musa from our RNC trek. Listened to Houndmouth. Planned out a cross country Amtrak trip. Hung out with Evgenia. Visited Trader Joe’s. Bought carrot juice. Race at 63rd street tomorrow. Made noodles. Carboload. Return of the duck pond.

Culdesac building walkable communities.

Evgenia came over from behind Ex Lib to say hi. She’s on, as she calls it, an “exchange program” from Harper Cafe. Talked experiences with the horde, bad trips to the DMV, and substacks. Told her about our plans for a cross country train trip, to which she said—“male behaviour is reading On the Road and thinking *I could do that*.”

Exercises in boredom are good for us.
