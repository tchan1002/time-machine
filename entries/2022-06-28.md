Day 84  
Met with Beymer. Dumplings for lunch. Fell asleep. Get back up buddy. Going to Boston on the 2nd might be the right move. Eat cereal grains for fiber. Investigated majors. Found a guitar, fumbled around with it. Cooked some more dumplings. Go out for a run. Freshen up and sleep early. Keep the water cycle going. Tuesdays and Taxi Driver. Travis Bickle. Went out around 8:40. Ran slowly but felt easy. Why is the forest enchanting? Fireflies. Caught Tommy. Really start reading again. Respond to Nguyen from EPVN. Set up Venmo. Sleep so we get a full day tomorrow.

The night we met in this sleepy new england town. 

I decided to take a hiatus from Bereal. It was too tantalizing just seeing people and not talking to â€˜em.
