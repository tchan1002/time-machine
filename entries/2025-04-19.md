#### Must Do's
- [x] Run

Slept in. Showered. Fog outside the window. Get up and get some food in us. Aadvik said hi to us in Baker, said he was visiting from WashU. Told us that Cam and Rishi just got kicked out of school last week. Kevin Treehan apparently was hot-for-fights upper year. Went out for a run, sailed into the sunset. Wheeled over to Jewel-Osco. Bought and made ourselves a steak. Called Aboo. Stopped by Ece's. Just dance. Spoke with Arjan about The God of Small Things and Midnight's Children. Time preserved in pickled mangos. 

Our slowness is costing us hugely. Diego's Not Interviews is lowkey running circles around us. We've got to change unless we want to die out. Probably wasting time to put stuff up as podcasts. Also, burnout is really really bad because it takes us out of our rhythm completely. 

因緣

Prove to ourselves that we're the type of person. Because the alternative is death. A slow imperceptible death. A fight club-esque take control of your goddamn life. 

Shower and go have lunch. Edit more episodes.
Too serious, smile more, smile wide. Cackle.
