Slept in. Found our way to the Reg. Read a couple chapters of Calvino. Six memos for the next Millennium. Transformers: Battle over Chicago. Peeked inside the Oriental Institute’s reading room. Egyptian hieroglyphics. Tiled ceilings. Went on a 2 miler through the Japanese garden. Returned via the Museum of Science and Industry. Here, a city of stone. Watched the Kierkegard episode on ant slavery.

The man is young again, his hair lush and black. Just a moment, before the wheel takes its course and the years come piling back.
