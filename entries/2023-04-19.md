Goofy-ah day. Had raspberries at Cathey. Reviewed and took our exoplanets exam. Kingdom of Heaven. Tuna bread. Met with Katie. Wrote our cover letter. Submitted our gradient of a scallion UChicago essay prompt, see if they’ll take it. Sent in our materials to the Our Hong Kong Foundation. Went to Lumen Christi. On the subject of friendship. Eggplant hummus. Murderous night, our eyes\!

Experiment of ephemerality,  
Leave our lips a sumerian echo—  
Utnapishtim the faraway,  
Ferried our virulent infantile dreams.
