Day 8  
Dim Sum. Picked up our bags. Left To Kwa Wan. Took the 東鐵綫 to Shenzhen. Berealed. 草帽石鍋魚. Feasted with Aboo and Gong Gong. Got foot massages. Walked to Shenzhen station. Met up with dad. Hong Kong, just a couple mountains in the distance. Said goodbye to Aboo and Gonggong. Boarded the train to Nam Cheong. Like great long snakes traversing the continent. Listened to music. Got to Nam Cheong late at night. Dad checked us into a hotel by the station. Showered and slept.
