Slept in. Left with Aurora for Beringharjo. Flowers for our mom and sister. Hamza batik. Awais and Trisha had the same idea. Larger pieces, a calendar, a table runner. A woven jacket for ourselves. Suit delivered to Jakarta. Ceramics. Walked around. Smoke rising from the masjid as kids fly kites. The Merdek feeling is strong, by the banners rising on every street. Kids race to finish krupuk tied on pieces of string. Didn’t get lunch today. Some stuff we can still get in Jakarta. Quit looking chopped. Dinner ayam kampung goreng. Ibu talked about her time in canada. Bapak showed us a booklet from the 1967 world scout jamboree. Selalu siap. Danilo came to send us off. How happy he was to have an american number in his contacts. Went with aurora to a coffee shop to write our 2 month reflection. Semua orang dari Jogja tahu di alkid ada dua pohon beringin, sangat besar. Go through them and you can fly.

Be more thoughtful in our gift giving
That’s a skill that we’re still learning
Mementos to keep us strong in our friends minds
A wooden calendar to flip and count the days
