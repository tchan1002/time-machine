**Day 32**  
319\. Woke up. Got dressed. Stopped by the IOP. Took the metra up to McCormick Place. NDI. 4 Tiramisus. Three women from Tibet, Senegal, Haiti. Votefest. Kimani intro’d us to Alan Cui from Nobles. Manned the backdoor with Trey. Shook hands with Brandon Johnson and Pete Buttigieg. Two compliments on our frog and toad shirt. Purvi got us into the DNC. United Center. Electrifying to be in that room, like one organism. Truly a religious experience. Wes Moore of Maryland. Saw some future presidents. Coach Walz. Gabriel let us crash with him at the Cloisters. 

Tim Walz and Up, Simba.   
From the redwoods to the Mississippi, just where we’re about to go. 

Something about Plasma HD, the characters on the big screen really do seem free-floating the longer you stare.
