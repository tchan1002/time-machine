**Day 80**
Heated up our giglis from last night. Lunch. Man we’re exhausted. Visited Anna’s. Set up our ipad. Helped Rodrigo move in his stuff. Tuscan pane and goat cheese log. Invited Faradawn over for dinner tomorrow. Called JF en route to dinner. The light falling again so beautifully into Woodlawn. Sat down on the law school benches. Got procreate. Drew and called dad. Went to the RA potluck in Gallo. 茶叶蛋.
