Day 91  
Woke up and made eggs for breakfast. Grab bread. Prepare rice and marinate meat at lunchtime. Head on a run when we get back from driving. Review to take our Greek and Latin placement tests. Complete placement exams by July 22nd. Greek and Latin. Look through the hum introductions on the canvas page. Moral MInds, Marc Hauser. Pre-reg not exactly working. Try again later. Review the CT driving manual. Fields of Life and Death. Snapped Jesalina.   
The apotheosis of memory. Our daily allotment. A confusion over momentarily. Filled in our pre-regs. Horrigan’s going on a pilgrimage. Driving lesson got moved to tomorrow. Take our own pilgrimage. Prepared our food. Rice is better washed. Good texture but a little burnt. Think we’ll cook right now because we’re getting a little hungry. American Factory. Went out for a run. Walked a couple laps, then ran a mile. 5:30 something to work with. Got our transcript in the mail. Really did our best and worst senior year. Conversational premoves. Umbrella Academy sneak peak. Lemon tea. Sitting under Saturn thinking about you. Crashing's actually a pretty funny show. What the freak does anal mean in British English.
