**Day 65**  
Morning panic. Guillermo, our lyft driver got us to Union Station in time. Little flowers en route to Milwaukee. Missed seeing forests. Made a stop at dunkinâ€™, two boston cremes for breakfast. Yasmin, Seth. Congressman Lahood. Tony Fabrizio. Lunch with Axelrod. Walked around Milwaukee. Billboards made a political battleground. Reporters descended like vultures upon the youth. Trey Gowdy. Marjorie Taylor Green. Shared the train back with the Amish. Walked back to South. Showered. Made toast. 

*The good and fine people at the RNC.*  
Doug Mills was probably there.
