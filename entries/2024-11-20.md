μυθος. Interior Chinatown. Breakfast with [[Daniel Mata]] and [[Nic Restivo]]. [[Uchi.destroy]], a uchicago destroy room. One man's trash is another man's treasure. Stellic founder was a college student at CMU. Chatted with [[Quincy]]. Grabbed lunch with [[Lucas]]. It may snow tomorrow. Kosher at Baker was bomb. End of Canvas File Downloader. Studocu has a soulseek model. Read up on Kyle Mooney. Back home in three days. The Chicago theater festival is back in town. Started snowing as we lyfted down to Chinatown. Our last scenes in Tiger's eye. Final four courses for prereg? Hope to God that we get these courses. Microchips are quite literally cut by light—a kind of screen printing. Reached out to [[Ben Heim]] to test the plugin he built. Rethink [[Who's On?]]. Lowk we just need to make 1 thing happen.

Teenage Engineering's visual design is so cool. Intrumentalis electronicum.
[Quantum computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28). Quantum might supply the shovels for AGI. TMSC might become something truly truly huge.
