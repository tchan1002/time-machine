Woke up to the wind howling. Moved to the third floor lounge for work. Reconnect with people. Keyboard’s getting here tonight. Worked on our transfer app. Daniel Fu joined us. Submitted our close reading. The XC boys down at New Englands. Walked to Woodlawn. Ran into Jack. Alive again, Chicago’s come back to life. Tiepolo’s Perseus and Andromeda. Put our food in the fridge to thaw. Lapham’s quarterly. Received nuts and coconut water from Dellara’s mom. Harmless Harvest coconut water, stuff’s delicious.

The chiming of the birds in snow and rain/ like waves set upon the sea.   
“I never thought that I would like to engage in evangelism, but…”

Thinking about those times coming back from cross country practice when we would go into Elm with the team. Hell week, good times.
