Early morning, snow on the midway. Went swimming with Mark. Put in the work for our IM meet. Baker type of morning. Finished Titus Andronicus. Aaron, *Thoughtless Cruelty.* Settled in the reg after lunch at Bart. Figured out pre-reg. Get ahead on our work. Dark *mater*, dark mother. Submitted our survivor app. Yuul vs Ozzie. The class consciousness in You. Took the shuttle bus to Bart, felt the haziness and clarity of an early morning. Read Norwegian wood. Arrived to find no fourth meal. Walked back and had Kung Pao chicken wings instead. Talked to Victoria down at Tiffins. Ended up in Victoria’s room in Woodlawn with Isaac and Bernardo etc. Sat in a corner until we lyfted to lambda. Ran into the Exeter contingent. Moved to Sig Chi. Ran into Isabella. Went back home with Sophia, I-Hunction part II. Connor, Richard, Clancy, Lucas and Gabby. Went to bed. 

Snippet: The snow reflected the sun and made the world gentle. *Albedo*, not to be confused with *asbestos*, which we feared in the popcorn ceilings of our youth. Scraped clean now, covered over with white. Passed the quad with a towel wrapped like a shawl—the wind formed mere echoes. The shrubbery shivered in ripples. Where to espouse our philosophy among these shadows?

No time for vagaries—*can I be close to you*?  
Song: Bloom by the Paper Kites.
