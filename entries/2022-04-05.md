Read Electric Sheep during Breakfast. Faculty reading next Tuesday night. Rushdie during CVP. Met Jakob at printmaking, Bradley’s kid. Had lunch with Holden and Jasper. Gave our tax presentation. Went with Harry and Oscair to buy lottery tickets at Trackside. Met Harry’s dog. Write a story about this town. Ran into McConnell. Might have cracked the code. Stay hydrated. Switch into the classics CVP. Took a nap. Might not be feeling too well. Went out to grab dinner. Go to the ISA meeting tomorrow. Stillwells? Wash up and see if we feel better. Only have printmaking tomorrow. Exonian merch. Coptic. Speaking in hieroglyphics. Shanghai under lockdown. The highways of a 25 million people city are empty. 

Tell me that love is an affliction of temperature,  
That attention is a matter of distance. 

Alright you caught me.
