Woke up and walked to Berkeley. Clear skies. Got our 702 objections sustained twice—goated round. Had burgers, then met Adith by Sather gate. Sizzling plates, to our stomach’s content. Went to Adith’s apartment. To Your Eternity. Met Adith’s roommate Adam. Talked about Mock Trial. Returned and sat in on P side’s closing. Snuck out before closing ceremony to catch a look of the sunset. The golden gate bridge is real. Shared a sunset with Emmet from Kentucky. Had Thai for dinner. Bought bread from Trader Joes. Talked to Isabella on the motel stairs. Kissed her. A moment in San Francisco.
