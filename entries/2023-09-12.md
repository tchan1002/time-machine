Thought we lost our keys in the morning. Scrawled down plans for Sliced Bread during RA training. Had lunch at Seoul Taco with Josie. Talked shop. Teams are living things. Met Moran outside his apartment for dinner. Had burgers at Small Cheval. Walked around Nicholâ€™s park. St. Thomas the Apostle church. Look for abandoned places on Wikimapia. Moran came up to our room. Snapped shots of Chicago from the 15th floor multipurpose room. Went out to the point. Swam in the lake, a view of the horizon. A baptism. Came back and showered. Water pressure in the first shower stall. Visit the art institute.
