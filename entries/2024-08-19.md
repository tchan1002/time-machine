**Day 34**  
Woke up to Salt Lake. Salt crusted. Saw some deer in the rugged landscape. Drafted another Linkedin Post. Kim and Wayne from the south coast of England. Near Poole. Say they like to take a pair of nude gnomes on vacation with them. Nice people. Colorado Mesas. Green River, UT. Cows so close. First mooners. Fresh air stop at Ramirez, CO. Right at sunset. Golden clouds. California Zephyr views are kind of unbeatable. Into the world famous lava tunnel, 2 miles long of dark. Approaching Denver, lights in the distance. Texted Maya. Tall hotels and glass windows. Spent 10 minutes in Denver. Walked out onto a street outside the station. 

Conductor at Glenwood Springs. This is the bermuda triangle of the Amtrak, we lose someone here every week to the smoke stop.
