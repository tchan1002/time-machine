Day 41  
Read Kafka on the Shore en route to Kwai Fong. Packed food bags at the warehouse. Had pho for lunch. Went back home. Slept. Aboo cut our hair. Had dinner. Broke down a little bit. Confirmed our trek itinerary for Singapore. Texted Kary. Felt much better. Revived via Mr. Brightside?\!\! 

God this summer. Think past versions of us have been more alive. It’s about killing the whale. Exercise our humanity. 

Nineteen. I think again and again and... Universal literature. On the word human.  
The passion of Catullus, the imagination of Calvino, the soul of Murakami. 

Summer has really soured us. Shell of a man. Don’t think we’ll forget our view out the balcony.   
On distant shores. “It is where great things are possible.” Hurts to be here in Hong Kong, to love it and see it dying. As if it is us—as if it is an image of ourselves. Stuck. Think that’s the most apt description of how we feel right now.

*Go and don’t look back.* American Dreams in China. Blinded by the Light.
