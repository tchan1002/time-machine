Did laundry in the morning. Slept in. Showered. Made butter and apricot jam sandwiches. Went to our psych lab. [[Mom]] wrote with news that our green card was approved. Lunch at Woodlawn. Submitted our playlist for WHPK. Moved to the Maroon office. Sipped on a hot chocolate from the center of spiritual life. Dinner with [[Tyler]]. [[Genesis]]. Got [[Obsidian]]. Dropped by a KSO event for food. Talked with Irene about our love for Mexico city. This year is the year we go supersonic. Midnight soccer. Shirts vs skins. Played a Wallace-Salisbury-Fama conglomerate. [[Andy]] on goal. [[Marshall]] went hard. Called [[Mom]] for her birthday.

Even if we’re 3 or 4 years behind the brightest people we know, we’re still in the same lifetime.
Build up our extended brain here on obsidian.
Tribalism is the only sustainable model, until we crack the code.

Note from Tyler: technology should not replace humans. The key to authentic design is that the human should never feel removed. 

Must be kind of easy to get into someone's accounts if they use the same password for all sites. We could use a website signup to collect people’s emails and passwords.

Think ephys shuttle drives—it took Jai a decade to breed an optogenetic-sensitive line of rats.
