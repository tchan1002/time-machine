Sent Yuto his pictures. Edited and sent in our summer breeze photos. Narrative Select could be a gamechanger. Kaya grad session. Went down South. Missed our meeting. Tired. Midnight yap session with Vanessa. 

Met a woman named Dot, who told us she was a photographer. Had no business card but showed us a picture of a plane she had in her wallet. *I took that.*
