Finished our Riovaz article. Went to our micro lecture. Grabbed food with Audrey after. Saw Ryan. Have to do something about our micro class. Our asociality will lead to an early demise—we must get out there. *You shall go and break bread*. Fundamentals app due this Friday. Pablo Picasso’s light paintings @Darius Twin. Israel Hamas on Last Week Tonight. Jeremy Zucker. Got to see supercuts with Joyce. Lyfted back with Noa and Tony. Fourth meal with Jacinta, Emily, and Sanah. To run a commune. 

Tragedy of the Commons. The buffalo herds that roamed the great North American plains. Hunted to near extinction, because we are optimizers. And “that which is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care”. Can we construct social norms to shift the cost equilibrium? To think of the Native Americans, to whom the land is not something to be owned, to whom ownership of the earth is unspeakable. 

Meta: We’re doing a buttload of things, entering the creative space. We are so cool. We need to move from spasms to fluid motion.
