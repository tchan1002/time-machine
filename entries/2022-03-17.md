Giancarlo Esposito. Wes Anderson. The French Dispatch. Read up on the Picture of Dorian Gray. Raiment. Read a couple pages or so of Hocus Pocus. Kurt Vonnegut. A resmashing of our galaxy. The Walled Garden. Duenos Inscription. Dulce et Decorum Est. Wilfred Owen. Strange Meeting, thatâ€™s what we read. The Book of Esther. A Song of Songs. Woah what the hell did we just read? They were not playing. The Golden Rule. Get washed up tomorrow.
