Put together our skateboard in the morning. Ducks returned to botany pond. Snow, changing of the signs. Lunch with Eric Harwood at Quantum. People do listen to our show live. Slipped out of Kapital to sleep. We tire ourselves. Baker chef takeover. Pepper steak goat. Recoup and work with clarity and purpose. Orsino innamorato. [[Papam]]. Farnese-moded. Called Yuk Sum. Pushup-failure, our shoulders are popping. Clean skin. We genuinely just look good. Ask Alexa if she's doing anything after SB meeting tomorrow. Midnight composed C+C essay, posted on [[Substack]].

Tomorrow chill, have breakfast, work through readings + homework. 
Need to shower and run more. These things always get our thoughts popping again.

Notes from Class 4/9
Metamorphosis, pupation of value, congealed labour from physical to imaginary, commodity to money in sale-purchase cycles. // As if transubstantiation. Bread and wine to body and blood of Christ. Moved through faith between realms physical and metaphysical. // Both or neither? Are we cannibals or are we not? Continuous oscillations. No stopping. Always becoming. Becoming unto becoming. // Money-thing-money-thing. metempsychosis this recycling of souls.

Grab our gear and just start rolling.
Where are we? Catch up on class.
Then publish Colin episode
Write 2 things.
Sleep an hour then scheme.
