Day 19  
Woke up. Went to dim sum with Aboo and Gonggong. Left for Hung Hom. Met Aabir on the platform. A little wait at the border. Took the Shenzhen metro to the convention center. Had 西北 cuisine at a 大秦小宴. Lamb skewers. Moved to OCT. A Chinese ethnic minority theme park. Tibetan temples and mongolian yurts. View upon a hill. Cultural dance show, Dai people ponchos. JD joined us in the evening. A miniature of Potala palace set against the Shenzhen cityscape. Man sized mushrooms on our way out. Asked 叔叔 to take pictures for us. Recharged our phones at dinner. Crispy shelled soft custard-like tofu. Took the train home. Aboo helped cut our hair. Showered and slept. A really nice day.
