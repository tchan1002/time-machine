Day 7  
Had kimchi fried rice. Remember to switch out the batteries in our bluetooth keyboard before we leave. Submitted our TAPs write up on Henrik Ibsen. Went out with mom for winter shoes and groceries. Telephone poles. 

Our theater readings are just making up words nowâ€”metatheatricality? Architectonics?
