**Day 57**  
Spent the day in a bad mood. Cleaned. Fixed the toilet. Opened the windows. Took singing in the shower to realize that we haven’t spoken in a while. Cleaned dishes. Salt on the floor. Went outside to observe dusk. Wonder where the ravens are. Craving cold winter nights. Relax face muscles. A late night vibes playlist. Get a skateboard when we get back.

We’d be sad if we died tomorrow. Our Jacob and Esau play.

Reboot manual: turn on music, declutter, shower, go outside.  
For our sanity. Create a separation of space—upstairs: sleep, downstairs: work. Shorten the distance it takes to go outside.
