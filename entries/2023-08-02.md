Day 37  
Left for work in the morning. MTR packed as usual. Grinded out our presentation at the office. Grabbed Hainanese chicken with Kary. The movie Her. Returned to the office and gave our presentations to Michael and Grace. Returned our keycards. Said our goodbyes. Kary showed us 大館. Place is really nice. Got dinner at Brass Spoons. Walked by Central Pier, till we found Tamar Park. A stretch of Green like the Midway. Laid down on a metal leaf—*have to get one of these things for our room*. Had a really nice convo with Kary on another metal tube installation. *We’ll be alright.* Went back home and did pushups. 

When we went to grab the ball in the dark and hit our head on a tree branch. The way she held a flashlight up to our face and asked if we were ok. We be *delulu*, quote Kary.
