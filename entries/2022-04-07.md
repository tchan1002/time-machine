Had a dream that we’ll miss this place really bad. Triple sleep in? Get through Electric Sheep reading. Goats and not sheep. The way of sorrows. Ascent to Golgotha. They really dicked me, a model Exonian. Taking Pedophilia in the Modern World. Going to be a long night with the CCC. So our posts look invisible in darkmode. Mutatis mutandis. Thaddeus Stevens. Had lunch again with Holden and Jasper. Get through some pages of There There before tomorrow. 4 hours? Definitely doable. Magic man. History bowl. Get to our meeting. Religious Specialist. Chicago Quizbowl. Went to CSO. Restore the long table. Went to eleven with the committee. Long night. Good to know we did something though. Tommy Orange coming tomorrow. 

A box of tissues on the table. Felix’s CCC case hit us hard.

Think there’s something wrong. Blood’s going from my head to my heart and it's supposed to be the other way round.
