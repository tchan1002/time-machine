Day 62  
Visited Chatuchak market. Invested in massage balls. Got gifts for family, thought it would be a nice thing to do. The exotic pet market. The forked hands of chameleons. Sugar-gliders indigenous to Indonesia. Returned to the hostel to shower before meeting Zander. Overslept, rushed over to the Paragon by BTS. Caught up with Zander. Had dinner at a Japanese restaurant. Got to talking about Sabrina? Distance of time gives much clarity. Our one real regret at Exeter. Realized we were similar and connected with Zander. Parallel lives, storylines finally meeting. Moonlight. Said goodbye as we went back and packed. Mr. Loverman in our head. Sat top bunk with Ashley to chat. Tired talking. Started missing Gabby wildly? Wish we had more self respect around her. Checked out of the hostel and took a grab car to the airport. The churning of the milk sea. Boarded our plane back home. 

Some stuff about family, remembered what we told Sabrina more than a year ago now on the bench overlooking the Squamscott. Actually really hurt to learn what she said about us in DC.

Snippet: Green Book, one Thanksgiving, we watched it in theaters. The Italian American bouncer drove the Black pianist down to the Deep South. And Christmas Eve on the way back, the city roads blanketed in snow. Some real nostalgia about our first Thanksgiving in America. The leftover Turkey, the dark meat of the bird mom made congee with. 

Song: Mr. Loverman by Ricky Montgomery.
