Woke up to the sunrise. Showered. Grabbed breakfast from Tiffins and sat down to work on the bees. Met with Tommy. Felt as if we had lost something great. Napped. Reset. Regretted not switching sosc sections. Meet with Moreau for office hours tomorrow. Pull ourselves out of this L day. Wizards by Ralph Bakshi. Frozen Twix bars. Submitted On the Bees. Gradescope tomorrow morning. The R2A Saga continues. Get back out there. The Bendigo Meteor. 

Song: Montezuma by Fleet Foxes.
