Brush our teeth and get outside. Procedure was a success. Southside with you. Phillip Roth. 1000 years in 8 hours. Took a look at our grades. Not great but teachers had some nice things to say. Move forward. Damon and Pythias. Pede Claudo. The negative of an image. The printing press. Frank Bango. Beauty as the most universal sign of good and ugliness as the most universal sign of evil. Finished Jekyll and Hyde. Hyde Park. Went out to buy groceries with mom. Talked to Frank. Gothic literature. The Stranger, what an edgelord book. The glow of the screen is doubly bright in front of a camera. Italo Calvino. Read novels for language, we can absorb information in other ways. Piraeus, an epic. Inherit the wind, the putting together of the bible and the origin of species. The Republic as a defense of Socrates. Tom Brady’s Back? Meeting Daniel tomorrow in New Haven. Wake up early. Writing the Modern Chinese American story. Bet Carbonell’s letter helped us out big time.
