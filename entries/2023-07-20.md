Day 50  
Met dad at Elephant Grounds in Admiralty. Arrived at work. Bali rice fields, wrote audio descriptions. Had Bibimbap for lunch. Another sad boi hour with Kary. Feeling an anger about this city? Changed before going to Sunshine Action. Had 譚仔三哥 for dinner with Ashley and Olger. Kary picked up the package we left at Qiming. Went home via 尖東. Make something with our own hands. A blue as we exited the To Kwa Wan mtr station. A silver Porsche Carrera. Called late night with the university over Sep 22, when Nelson lent us his shirt. Wake up tomorrow, shave. Take care of ourselves.

Didn’t realize we could see stars in Hong Kong.  
The problem of human division. It’s about shared conversation topics. Conversational economy.
