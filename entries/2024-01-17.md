Dress to impress. Rhea and Kate interviewed us for DSP. Hope things turn out for us. Met Monica from Pareto, *Fashionopolis*. Sat down with Ryan and Penelope in the A level. Walked back to North. Met with Mason. Had some hot chocolate with Aneth at Plein Air. Dropped by Trott. Ran back to an all-staff meeting. Made two “coupons” for Leela and Jacob. Chill out this weekend and start doing our homework.
