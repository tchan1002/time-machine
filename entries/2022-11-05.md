Battered much on land and sea on our walk to woodlawn for breakfast. Picked up our lanyard from the midway. Going climbing at 2:50. Finished our gradarius. Ramanujan. Took the metra with Matt, Jack, Dellara and Sophia to climb. First Ascent. Micro-Abrasions. Tackled a V2. Had a good time climbing. Ate at Chipotle. Waxing gibbous moon. Moon journals. Slept on the Metra. Straight up? Monotropa plants.
