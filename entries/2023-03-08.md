Woke up at 6:00. Sunrise. Finished our artist statement for *Hourglass.* Chills. Cathey dweller. Sat down with Olivia Rae. Requested an incomplete for our math exam. 

Fever thoughts:  
*Love makes us poets,*  
*Sickness makes us humble,*  
*We are all conglomerates of thought,*  
*Socrates was the last person who knew anything,*  
*and he died a million gazillion years ago.*
