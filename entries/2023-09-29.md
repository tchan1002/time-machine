Went to our Booth FA class. Felt like a whiz kid. Had lunch with Zofie. “Winning the room.” Tabled for sliced bread. Manned the stand for 2 hours til Josie came. Taped a poster to our shirt. Guerrilla advertising. Recruited Mateo Connelly to come behind the table with us. Went with Ryan to Theater 24\. Grabbed a quick dinner before leaving with Annie to pick up ice cream from Target. Mid-autumn moonrise, like a cutout in the sky. Talenti, what luxuries. Grabbed eggs, because they’re just nice to have. Left for the point with Ryan after our house event. The moon cast our shadows on the grass. Mock around a fire. Funny feeling to see all these people together again. Max and Ryan got a little drunk. Sat on the rocks. Talked to Olivia Rae. Got back a little after midnight. Found ourselves locked out of our room. Made eggs in a cup. Went outside and took pictures of the moon. Ran into Noah by the smart museum. Long night, we showered and slept.
