Day 64  
Had a quick breakfast. Took a bus from the Victoria Monument bus center. A ticket checker at the helm. Tickets dispensed from a cylindrical case like saran wrap. Sent Chloe a picture of a woman wearing Choate branded sunglasses. Met Father John at a Makro supermarket. Thai Yogurt. Met a stranger named Abdul, who spoke Cantonese. Abdul gave us a rendition of 上海灘. Loaded up our foodstuffs onto a pickup truck. Ashley and Olger rode in the back. Unloaded our food by a temple by Lak Hok, for the Viet and Khmer Krom refugees living there. Photo-op. Sunny called us a real politician. Father John drove us to his house. Drove by Klong Prem prison. A Prayer Before Dawn. Zoomed with ACS at Father John’s house. Had Tom Yum at a local restaurant. Closed wok burner attached to a vent, the oil iridescent. Said goodbye to Father John. Went for a Thai massage before having dinner at the Paragon food court. Walked around the night market at Jodd Fair. A Thai Band playing Chinese songs. The Sinosphere. Watched the Flash at the Paragon. *What did we just see?* Stood for the king. Texted Zander. Split a rambutan with Ashley and Olger in the hostel kitchen. Had some water. Slept. 

Trailer for the Man Suang movie looked fire.
