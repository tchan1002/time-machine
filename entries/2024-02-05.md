Zone in. Grabbed a little breakfast at Bart. Migraine hitting us hard. Left our investments midterm. Watched the sunset from our room and felt serenity. Reminded of how nice last spring was. *I Think We Danced* by itsjustrand*.* Ran into Ruka in Saieh. Went to a micro discussion section. Grabbed Cathey with Ryan and Emily after.
