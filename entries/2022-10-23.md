Slept in. Been slacking off. Focus on things that win us points. Donâ€™t stop dreaming. Carl Sagan. Did our gradarius. Maroon Marketplace. Moved to Mock practice. Wrote our Gelfand Cross. Go visit the field museum. Ate at Woodlawn. Returned to ihouse with Sophia.

Song: Cecilia by Simon and Garfunkle.
