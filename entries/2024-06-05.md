**Day 107**  
Early start. Got up at 6:50 and walked over to South. First shift. Rode around on a golf cart. Made steak and dumplings with Cam and Alvin. Ran into Ky in the HRL office. Found ourselves talking about Hawkins and Buyan. *Educators*—*they really are in the business of changing lives.* Laminated. Moved out of North and into South. Sasha came and helped us with the carts. Golden hour. What a view\! Set up our room with the things we scavenged: carpets, afghans, and lighting. A nice pan and kitchen knife too. Had a really nice shower. We cooked\! 

We’re the baby driver of laminating.

Study things that make us pause. That’s the art we want to make.   
*You gotta stay prayed up, you got me?*
