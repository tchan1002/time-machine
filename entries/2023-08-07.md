Day 32  
Went down to Wong Chuk Hang at 2:00. Visited 36 Technology, a VR Developer. Went thrifting in Mong Kok after. Lots of Japanese work uniforms at Em and Gees. Shawn found a jacket for us. Bought a tripod and a new pair of headphones. Ate at the Dragon City Cafe. Went back home. Couldnâ€™t fall asleep. Listened through *Woodland* by the Paper Kites. 

Summers swallowed in silence. Sadder still, I think I prefer it like this.

Put on an oculus quest for the first time, and had an acute sense that this is the future. Virtual real estate. Infinite worlds for people to live in.
