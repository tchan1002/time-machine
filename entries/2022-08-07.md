Day 44  
Go swim. Get some ice cream. Reading the mosaic at Yale. Summer salt. Clarkâ€™s in Connecticut. Abandoned Breast and Eggs. Tackle Cosmicomics. The Aquatic Uncle. Old English. Learn the IPA. Read the first chapter of Anabasis. Tackle the books we have. Very tempted to go on a long distance trip. Made cheesy tomato rice. Talked to Jasper. Put our clothes in the launders. Put our clothes in the dryer. Rain. Took a walk with Clark around the stadium. As if a smuggler. Stay with Clark in New York?
