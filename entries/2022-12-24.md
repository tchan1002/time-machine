Day 9  
Ankles a little sore from yesterday. Vivid dreams lately. Pollo campero. Looked through Arhon’s college essays. Emailed Charlotte about house funds. Planned our March break trip with mom. Mock grind. Books getting shipped today. Tomatoes, a culinary delight. 

Dreamt that we ran into Jacqueline and Maya on a train platform. Caught Jacqueline smiling at us from the top of a set of stairs, and fumbled our way up. Was planning to go to the zoo, but ended up talking with her instead. From the platform, the city was an expanse. We were in this fictional Chicago, a Tokyo blend. Chased each other through the shops of an underground mall, through a sushi restaurant where a very friendly Japanese family offered us a slice of whale tongue. Lost her at a corner, but think we made peace with it.
