Day 55  
Took the train to Tuen Mun. Visited Yan Oi Tong. Bamboo scaffolding. Talked to Yu Dong. 董小姐. A liberal education. Start reading again. Still about Exeter. Took the train back home. Napped. Went out to Aabir’s. Met Lucy and Andrew. Never Let Me Go, remembering Hailsham. Fill out our metcalf tomorrow and start building our financial forecast.

Ask for Qiming’s internal files on Monday 

Snippet: Saw the poor, the sick, the dying, and realized an anti-Siddhartha. Too hungry. Money is a matter of human dignity. Still when we see children with their parents. Though we know the world owes us nothing.
