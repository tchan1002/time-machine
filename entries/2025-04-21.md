Pope Francis passed in the wee hours of the morning. Read Kapital. Showed up for Pope Class. Habemus papam, though not our father. Interviewed Nickâ€”Perspective Health. Went to dinner with William at Imperial. Wrote him a neat little card from Trader Joes. Peking duck. Really nice mango cake from Tous les Jours. Dance off in the square. Quad off? 100 buck prize. Plans for war.

The sun came out in the latter half of the day, as we were sailing from Trader Joes. Everything was all so nice. Time to start moving as Valentino Borgias. Write our letters to our mother about our experience in the sistine. Start plotting big and impressive moves.
