Woke up at 4:00. Took the uber to SFO. Isabelle lent us a copy of Never Let Me Go to read on the plane. Bawled our eyes out, missing Hailsham. *Acres of ploughed earth*. So cold in Chicago, breaths visible. Stood outside the terminal with Harrison and Kody. Uber dropped us off at North. Ate at Bartlett. Went to our TAPs class. Babylon, Damien Chazelle. Had dinner with Emberlynn. Cleaned up.
