Day 4  
Woke up at 7:30. Head out to the slopes. Magic carpet. The sun came out on the mountain. Must have snowboarded for 6 or 7 hours. Pasta for dinner, turn in olive oil. 

Afflicted with a reflection. A modern narcissus with a photographic obsession.   
I am the alien that ate the alien that ate me.
