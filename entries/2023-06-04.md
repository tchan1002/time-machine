, Day 96  
Took the Yamanote line to Yurakucho. Matcha cream puffs. Met Yuto at the Ginza exit. Walked to Kabukiza. Matahei the Stutterer. *The spirit hath pierced through stone*. Tsukiji fish market. Big uni fan. Had whale nuggets, a collective crime. Found a lettuce farm inside Itoya. Hokusaiâ€™s monkeys. Yuto showed us around the G6 rooftop. Gaijin recklessness. Had some ramen and rice by Tokyo station. Brides and their bridegrooms taking wedding pictures. 

*Starving\!*
