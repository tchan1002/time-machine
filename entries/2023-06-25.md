Day 75  
Showered. Ramona, Scott Pilgrim. Music from the Rick and Morty Planetina episode. If we could just take flight. Met Aboo and Gonggong at the Dim Sum place. Showed them pics of Chicago and Exeter. Travelled via Google Earth. Took the train, then the 6 bus to the cricket club. Waited for Russell by the parking booth. A black moth in daylight. Met Angie in the club’s restaurant. Had a prawn laksa. Bowled, practiced the leg swipe. Talked with Ina on the bus to Repulse Bay. Intergenerationality. Caught up with Clark about college, thoughts on the pervasiveness of alcohol. Swam out to a platform with Angie and Ina. Rushed to Nam Cheong, our shorts wet, via Ocean Park. Met a couple people from LSE. Olger vs 婆婆 in badminton. Worked with the homeless to get them haircuts. Helped a man onto his wheelchair. Took the Tun Muen line back home. 

Snippet: Ina asked us what our takeaway was from Exeter. So we told her about last summer. At Charlie Preston’s house with JaQ Lai realized in us the idea of a sort of intergenerationality that persists past grad. Intergenerationality that continues in the relationships we have with alumni and people still at the school. Relationships formed by kids parenting kids. Something we valued greatly—and perhaps unique about Exeter. Though Chicago has taught us much and transfojjrmed us in ways we could not have imagined. 

The great memory machine.   
Woah, get on R2A. we’re losing track of days.
