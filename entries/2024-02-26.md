Woke up. Zoomed Josh for our writing consultation. Went back to bed. Relentless sleep. Made 柠茶. Had lunch with Alec. Section out 2 hours each day to work on investments. 顽童. Went on a little music marathon with Vanessa. 

This morning, some feeling we can only call a gnawing numbness. Will the Wombats bring us back? We’re in our head trying to mold ourselves again into becoming. A cut-up lip. We write treatises on self, perception, reality; time, randomness, intelligence; hunger and drive. *Yolk, Whale, Dog* in our head. And outside, the quad comes back alive again. Visions of spring feed eternal sunshine. 

Realize that we need so much to make Sliced Bread happen. Even just the question of consistent issues—really just have to get our first one out. We need a team of dedicated editors—figure out how we can effectively communicate.
