Steer clear of reputational risks. A church for the faithless may function as a church but cannot be called a church. Went to Luke's to film. Sang. Wrapped for the day. Figured out invoices at Baker. [[Basquiat]]. Consult symbols. Nap. Dinner with Colbert. We could be lost in soundwaves. WHPK experiment with Sean. It is odd to chat in front of an audience, figure out how we can make things smooth. Hung out with Tori. Kid came in and turned the lights on. Talked Basquiat. 

Let the money flow and let the good times roll.
Cream soda limoncello could be great.

Best thing about money is when we don't need it. Have people owe us and owe them frequently. Our financial ties are social ties, exchange is connection. Ownership is care.

Be direct: passivity is inconsiderate.
