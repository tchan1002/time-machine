Had breakfast. A blackout poem for Midnight’s Children. Honey drops and rice milk. Entries have been short. Miserere Me, Deus. The Golden Age of Palaeontology. Book of St. Albans. Sun Goes Down. Hern and Señor Guffy. Feeling rather dull these last few days. Rest in the fact that our future is secured. Let's just get Miranda done today. Showered. Kitboga. Reboot Project Gigachad. Had fettuccine. Charlie called about spending the night over at his place after grad.
