**Day 69**  
Eeking out this existence. Made noodles. Passed our 6 hour drivers ed course. Steven Cheung, Trump’s spokesman. Consider the Lobster. Quick bite with Cole. Texted Shalom. Hopped on the Metra. Met Will and Jonathan. Saw news that Trump got shot. Bullet whipped by his head. Went to the Cavetown show. Show got moved back an hour from thunderstorm warnings. Ran into Tate and friends. Got back via Yaser. “Hyde Park?” Thunderstorms. CVS. Back home. Drenched. Sleep. Recoup.

Could be a huge article if we write it well.

Start of summer we thought the cicadas would come in droves. Saw our first one of the summer today outside our window and wondered where our shell-shedding went.   
Senator Jenkins?
