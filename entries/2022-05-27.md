Take yours, I'll take mine. PEAN yearbook assembly. Did loan interest problems with Jacqueline. Notes on Looking Back by Steven Tagel. Signed up for the national convention. Uncle Phil. Went to grab a PEAN with Holden and Jasper. Bojack Horseman’s the View from Halfway Down. Ginger chews. Visit Toronto when we’re in Chicago. Sat in Hartnett’s room for a good while. We’ve done good work in a short time. Went to Ultimate Frisbee. Dropped by the field house. Felt sad for the first time in a while. Our bucolic youth. Captain crunch like golden sand, ice cream on steroids. Last Kirtland meeting of the year. Ascension under auspices. Played ultimate discus. Thomaso and Caspar absolutely cracked. Went down to the pier. Talked to Eamin about cross country. Shower and freshen up. Teatulia iced tea. Stranger things. Do laundry tomorrow. Keep the end in sight. Origami may not be our thing.
