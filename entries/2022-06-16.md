Day 96  
Cut our hair and showered. Reconnected with Lamaan on bereal. Keep moving forward. Took out the trash. Cooked some rice. The last of the croissants. Think we’ll do better next time. Anna Sorokin. Keep the water cycle going. Schedule our next driving lesson. Wok hei. The Maillard reaction. Willowdusk, life outlets, and a pack of small lifelinkers. Called Shalom. Thawed out ribs for dinner tonight. Went down to the track. Went fast. Met a group playing soccer. Joey. Only a few hours to change a day. Train to win now. Go out walking maybe. Did 40 pushups in a row. Haven’t done that in a long time. Keep working. Make latin and greek recordings to listen to on walks. Think we made ourselves better today. 

The difference between a good and bad haircut is about three weeks.
