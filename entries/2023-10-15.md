Stopped by the Maroon Arts. *Almost Famous*. Met Angelique. Maybe we’ll finish our article on Kanii. Went to Luke’s apartment to rehearse for Otherworld. First day on the set. Ran lines with Quinn. Took our couple pics in the park. The sunset in our room\! Took out our camera. Grabbed dinner with Aabir, Lucy and Andrew at the Nile. The *arayis* was bomb, a crispy delight. Went down to the midway. *Magnum dong.* The song from the Boys. Printed out our religion readings. Gary, Indiana this weekend.
