Found our lion card. Arrived at breakfast to finish our one page response. Used “cogent” in a paper. Boink.io with Kevin, Mikey and Vincent. The Nosa Lawani Folders. Had lunch with Maya and Grace from Ultimate Frisbee. Beef turnovers. IT office on waterstreet. Charger was in our bag the whole time. Damp from the rain. Had root beer floats at Weth with Jacqueline, Lara, and Maya. Talked about Catullus. CSO turnovers. Had a meeting with the CCC. Dropped off things for Daniel. Called Aboo briefly. Shower. Work on “the Dawn.” Return our library copy of Electric Sheep and work on our Ted talk. Busy weekend.

Losing a lot of good men.  
What is a lewd man? One who goes down on the buttocks.
