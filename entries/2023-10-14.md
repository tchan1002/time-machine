Went down to woodlawn to talk bread with Ashley. Branding, the wide angle bread shot. Took the green line down to Chinatown. Had dim sum at Imperial. Came back, took a nap and got knocked out. Slept for 4 hours. Grabbed dinner at hutch with Aabir and Lobo—met Cyrus from Hong Kong. Got our friends to donate their meal swipes. We’re in Firebird\! Got casted by Fire Escape. Big creative era. Get back to photography. 

Snippet: If the world was just a 5 by 5 feet sliver of rock jutting out of the blue sea—a man will stand there for all eternity. he will not jump.
