#### Must Do's
- [x] Maroon Key Application
- [x] Stamps Request Money

Spent the night on our bean bag/couch setup. Went down to Baker. Had a quick bite before meeting [[Harris]] and going up to 53rd. Met Noah Alfman at Philz, who's working on a social movement called Heroes. Talked Kierkegaard and Joseph Campbell. Noah's wrestling with many of the same questions that we have. But how do we make something specific enough? Look for unexpected analogs to inform [[Design]] processes. Stopped by rehearsal at Cobb with Tiger's Eye. Went back to north and made food. Bread, eggs in fried kimchi and scallions. Read Amitav Ghosh and napped. Bedouin dress. Listened to Fleet Foxes. Out of a daze. Got dressed. Bought our first wines at Trader Joes. Brought them over to Kavya. Checked in at Ida. AKDphi was holding their conference? Packed up AV, shadowed Eric on a round of the building. Korean culinary class wars. Stayed up watching the Penguin.

Try Mino Lee's monk mode for a week.
Listen to music and read when we want to jerk off. 

[[Transcendence]].
Learn to let things go. 
Talked to Kevin from Hallowed about the night shift. Twilight hour of weird calm. Time-warped almost. Eric the facilities manager called us "brother."
