Snowfall gently on church lights, the wind howled a ghostly film. Harambe. Hyde Parks. Mammoth heart. Proctoring EMCC. Talk to Ben about Gains. Blood on the leaves. They really banned Maus in Tennessee. The moon. Do laundry today. Beef strips. Jerky is a new world food? Buddy the hippo and Nero the dimetrodon. Desktop 1/29. Rewrite history to edit our souls. *Scala naturae*. Chain of being. Digging through notes on our phone. “Sophiemore.” Sunshine in the garden. Made snow globes with Shalom. Visited Will House. A figure memento mori.

Space is dark no matter the stars, but the heavens are alight to the lovers gazing.  
Stargazing, grass-gazing. 

Prompt: Monologue in front of a titanoboa exhibit.

Dreamt that you were crying in a museum. I held out my hand and you told me that I wasn’t very good at comforting people. You showed me these works of art. We walked by a kitchen that sold groceries. You bought ginger; I got ice-cream. We walked down a set of stairs and the stairs were spherical pieces of floating glass. Reminiscent of the files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. We left the museum through an exit hatch—we were 50 feet off the ground. When we climbed the ladder down, I realized I had to go home.
