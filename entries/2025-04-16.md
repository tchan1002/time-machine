#### Must Do's

[[Papam]]. Recieved our cardinalship at the start of class. Hiccup with the Cybos. 10 votes for borgias at the end of class. YC talk. Caught up with Ben Burgess, now building an interactive word map for couples to find shared topics of interests which evolve over time. Shared him our substack. Reminded of the chain. Run and pushups tomorrow. Back to the exponential life.

YC Talk Notes:
Jared Friedman and Ankit Gupta. A purely people based heuristic for finding successful startups. A founder is a type of person, not a role. Ankit's advice for solopreneurs is to find a cofounder. Because all startups die by suicide—not homicide—and just having someone else makes it much harder for you to give up. In terms of cofounders, either look for someone you know extremely well, or find someone you have a history of building projects with. 

Ben Burgess:
Somebody app was a public art project that invited strangers to become vessels for messages sent over the internet. Think sleeper agents activate to deliver a breakup text.
