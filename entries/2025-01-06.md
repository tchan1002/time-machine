Went down to baker for breakfast. Felt exceedingly bad. Slept in. Still none of our classes yet. Showered.  Maybe we just need to cook for a little bit. Snowfall. Light mist. Maroon meeting. Had dinner with Tiffany. Told her about Marina Keegan. Little crises of faith. One class out. Texted Joe and Cristi that we're planning not to be an RA next year. Called Mel. Clay potsâ€”just start making them. Read through syllabi. Dropped by bartmart for showerstuffs and an onigiri.

We've done an emptying. Slough off the old. Wormheart.
