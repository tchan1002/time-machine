**Day 72**  
Slept in. Day out at the White Sox. An immaculate 9th inning from Michael Kopech. What a win\! Mother mother on Saturday. Napped. Ran with Juliana. 2 miles to the point. 4 miles up the lake. 2 miles back. Tomorrow laundry \+ clean up. We’re feeling good. *Sit in the office and knock out drivers ed.* Made a wicked dish of 刀削面 in tomatoes. The juice\! Moneyball. 

Where men first flew. “They put a man on the moon\!”   
Can’t be too much of a degenerate if we want to make things happen.  
Don’t ever bitch out. Art is procedural. Allow ourselves to sandbox, iterate.   
There will always be a place in the world for good fruit teas. 

*What is brat summer?*  
*Bringing the culture to you.*
