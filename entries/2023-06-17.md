Day 83  
Woke up early in the morning. Grabbed milk and some bread before heading out. Took the bus down to an industrial building in Kwai Fong. Packed fortune bags, got good footage. Grabbed some conveyor belt sushi before taking a taxi to HKU. Sunny briefed the HKU med kids on interacting with the homeless. Microgestures have big effects. Afternoon tea, Sunny told us he grew up in Venezuela. Wandered around Causeway bay, stopped at a calligraphy exhibit on the bottom floor of the Central public library. Portrait of a monkey. Grabbed some ramen. Freshened up at Ashleyâ€™s place. Went to Lan Kwai Fong with Olger and Ashley. Met our man Don. Ran into Angela, who was asking to be saved from her bumble date. Left early, took the metro home, worked on a coolcat. The croaking of a frog in the gully.

Snippet: When last, among some classics conventionists, we realized we were getting old, and put to rest our weary sack of bones. When were we last consumed by the pure ecstasy of each other, no alcohol, no nothing?
