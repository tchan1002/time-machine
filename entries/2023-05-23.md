Golden hour. Rush. Submitted our apes report by 8\. One down, two more to go. Review for astro hard. Met with Beymer. Head out to eat at Baker. Ran into Misaki. Reviewed for Astros on the A level with Sergio and Alec. Took our final, hope we did ok. Lost our ID, Alec guest-swiped us into Woodlawn. Walked to the reg, outlined our poli-sci final. Walked back with Ben. Make this summer good. 

The motion of the stars. Koko showed death-awareness.    
The red edge. Rogue planet. Wanderers.   
FLAG grant for next yearâ€”be on the road always.   
So glad to be in the beautiful city of Chicago.
