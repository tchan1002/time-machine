Found our lost ID in the laundry room. Had breakfast then went to the reg. Sent Mr. Ng a travel guide for Chicago. Walked back up to North. Wrote cards for mother’s day. Crashed and napped for a couple hours. Went to our RA meeting. Scallion pancakes for the week? Walked up to CVS and back. *Classy Girls.* Sat down with Ahtziri and Sho. Summer plans—signed up for the prairie. Manar’s candy. Put 50 dollars in as an investment. Allulose/ alternative sweeteners for Willy Wonka. Get a skateboard. Return AVS equipment tomorrow.

Negotiate a metcalf before May 11\.   
Need to plot a chart now to Forbes 30 under 30\. 

Summer goals:   
Make amigo happen.  
Get a drivers license

What we’ve been thinking about is governance. Governance over ourselves and over the things we do. Synergize: use Sliced Bread and Sunshine Action as outreach for Amigo, we two-bird-one-stone. Make our insta 360 purchase and then acquire audio too. Hop on the interview grind. Make our start here in Chicago—we’ll rise to take back the East. *Though we cannot make the sun stand still, yet we will make him run.* 

Practically, what does this mean? Trying to cultivate a social media presence? Maybe—though we want a community that will follow us anywhere.
