Rainy Zurich. Great fields and pines on our way in. Submitted our Paperino 2 on Ulysses. Signed ourselves in to a lounge. Showered and brushed our teeth. Vichysoisse soup, rich. Stayed in there for about 10 hours. Slept. Tonight we fly back to Hong Kong and start the summer. 

The folly of age cannot doom him. It can't even touch. 
Family is never the impediment to us doing somethingâ€”our will is.
Don't let small spaces suffocate us, find ways to get out there and stay clean.

Smile crack-toothed.
