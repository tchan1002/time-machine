Wrote and sent in our RA app. Michael Moran joined us for breakfast. Had our RA interview with Rich. Chill Weekend? Had lunch at Bart. Did our Galaxies quiz. The room upstairs by the bathroom—a collection of African masks. Went back home and napped. Not feeling the best. Jasper called. Showered and finished Intergalactic. Went to sleep early.

This is not a thing of time or circumstance. We are here, we are alive, and we are real.
