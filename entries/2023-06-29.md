Day 71  
Took the train to Wong Chuk Hang. A moment of awareness in the train station, dead reckoning, the veil lifted. Visited the Anti-Cancer Society. An anthology series for cancer patients? Recording lives, memory.com. The Farewell, a phenomenon of families choosing not to tell the elderly that they have cancer. Rode the train to HKU for some Hunanese cuisine with the public health masters students. Went home. Texted Bill Baker about his resemblance to Hughie in The Boys. Meeting Alec in Singapore in August. The Supreme Court affirmative action decision came around midnight. Blanketed our instagram feed.

NZT-48, an intelligence enhancing drug. Limitless.
