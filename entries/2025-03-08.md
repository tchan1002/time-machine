#### Must Do's

Breakfast at Roux with Anderson, Ryan and Belew. Sent Adam off. Thomas Wang. 常乐佛. Quit jacking off—it's not harmless. Rethink self-control. Went into the lab. Ate with David Ma at Bart. Back home. Squandered our time a little. Allen Xia in town. Went out for a run. Revised our hors d'oeuvres article. Publish, but be stringent with our culling. Golden rule: no one cares (until you give them a reason to)

Las Olas is a mexican restaurant, as is El Burrito Mexicano off the Addison red.

Unproductive triggers: heavy meal, got into bed, didn't turn on the lights, scrolled, saw emotional reels, started yearning, ended up watching chungking express.
Next time, intervene at "heavy meal" and turn on the lights when we get back home. 

[[Keep in Mind]]: The thing that we've wanted to engineer most is a system that learns. Something that takes feedback and gets better iteratively. The most ambitious of these systems is ourselves. Think about discipline as a consensus problem among versions of present and future. How do we design a system to get these self-interested selves to agree to invest? How do we tie them together?

Potential solutions:
1. create a new norm "do you want to be a loser?"
2. track who contributed and who didn't. (make every day a unit)
3. make a project that grows over time + remind each of the existence of the other.
