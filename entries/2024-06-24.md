**Day 88**  
Woke up to Manar doing sit ups. Did laundry. Met Raphael and Berto from a humanities program. Had the last of our mangos. Dinner with Anna. The light falling so beautifully into woodlawn. Our leg might be a little banged up. Went on a jewel-osco run with Nolan. Glazed cinnamon rolls. AJR. Thunderstorms.
