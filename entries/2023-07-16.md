Day 54  
Nearing the middle of summer. Listened to our February playlist. *What a winter.* The giant cigar store Indian on South Pulaski. Xi Jinping in Muscatine Iowa. Jacob’s Ladder 1990\. Filled out our metcalf survey before heading out. Met dad at Sha Tin. Ate at a Din Tai Fung. Elderly bionics? Something to look into. Went home. Captive killer whales. Typhoon hitting tonight. Talked to Josie about Sliced Bread. Watched Bohemian Rhapsody. Keep dreaming. *Who wants to live forever?* Recalled mornings suiting up at the motel 8 in Irvine or Berkeley. 

Snippet: Green Leaf Industries, the disaster company. Air filtration and roach bars. It was one burning in the summer of ‘23. The image of a smog filled New York City.
