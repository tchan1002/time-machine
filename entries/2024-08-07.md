**Day 44**  
Called Aboo. Cleaned dishes. Rebooked train tickets, so now we’re just headed to Portland. Went down to the A level. Spent a couple hours trying to make VS Code work. We’re out of our depth. Caught up with Shiloh. She’s been working with the Alumni magazine. Dropped by Trader Joes. Made bolognese giglis. Had them with Luke. Slept. Did pushups. 35 in one go. Tomorrow we will go farther. Kirk Crippens’ Portraitlandia. Subwaydle for Chicago? Chicago Roller Skate Co. Federal Plaza.

Skate the 606 tomorrow. Then, village discount. Dinner at Chinatown (Ken Kee with Tyler).
