Called dad in the morning. Shaved, showered. Had lunch, took the day to recoup—return to the land of the living. Cut our hair. Nice rough cut. Cleaned up our room. Dinner. Piano recital. Taman Budaya behind Fort Vrederburg. Insane production value intro for a piano recital, and the MC had an ungodly voice (we thought it was just audio.) Sudden nostalgia. Fragments pursuing total recall. Hot tea downstairs in our hamden home. Gocared home with pak. Tried a new fruit from papua, matoa, a cross between lengkang and a lychee. RSVPed for Hong Kong UChicago alumni activities. 

We're so tired, wiped out. Gotta just grab some sleep.
Rebuild the body. Eat good. Sunburnt and tanned.
Don't fall into the trap of mimetics—wanting what other people want.
Look into rene girard.
Take more agency for our life. Fall deeply into fantastic fictions. 
River run thither, tithe thee well.

Two Native Americans arrived in 19th century England to showcase the first instance of the front call.

How do we write the work to shock the culture? What culture are we responding to? What world do we dream of.
