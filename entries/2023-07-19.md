Day 51  
Had breakfast with Michael Chiu. The economy is a matter of national destiny. Read Goldman’s report on China. Grabbed lunch with Kary from Don Don Donki. Ate with people in the office. We goofy. Signed onto Google Labs. Generative AI becoming commonplace. Listened through Sufjan Stevens’ *Illinois*. Aboriginal Persons Displacement Localities. Will it play in Peoria? Met Remus on the deal team, who went to Choate. Adopt an entrepreneurial spirit. Went back home. Napped. The End of the Fxxking World. 

Feeling this frustration? Getting upset. Claustrophobic. As if in a cryogenic pod. Have to remain lucid. This other life. Re-associate. 如係躺喺擔架床.
