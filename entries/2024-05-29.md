**Day 114**  
Did room checks in Snitchcock for SHA Training. Started writing in a notebook. Took pictures for Vikram and Shama. Shama got us some dinner from Seoul Taco. Kimchi fried rice and a spicy pork bulgogi. Made a target trip. Conzen was not our bro :(. Go forth with direction. Maybe we’ve become too disillusioned with school. Plotted out a path for amigo. Time to execute it. 小杨生煎. Called Aboo.

Picnic basket:  
Tuscan pane  
Nice jam  
Cold cut/cheese plate.   
Orange juice.

Paper to do lists.
