Montell Fish last night. Spent the morning on our interview guide. Submitted and filed it away. Finished our Psych final. 10 degrees out. Ate at Woodlawn with Youssef. Prep for tomorrow. Had little ice cream. Called Mom. Called Aboo. Went over to Jimmy's to meet with some people in our English class. Fire drill. Jerk chicken. Really really good. We are happy. 

Dad’s birthday on the horizon. Would be nice to get him a video cameo.
Order summer flights back to HK. We’ll likely be back in Asia anyways.
