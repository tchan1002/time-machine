Woke up and did our laundry. Packed all our belongings in four bags. Picked up a map of Europe. Went to cottage grove with Ben. Put our stuff in the storage unit. Ben guest swiped us into Woodlawn. Grabbed food. We’re ready to go. Call a lyft at 5\. Packed two bananas. Daylight by Maroon 5\. Asteroid City. Sat downstairs at Tiffins before checking out. Took an uber to Midway. Wrapping up this year in Chicago. Accepted into Trott. Syzygy. Write when we’re in Tokyo. Telling jokes. Sunset flight home. 西湖，无尽头. The Farewell. Mom picked us up at Hartford in a big white car. 

Snippet: A serenity gained upon exiting the bubble, like our summer post Exeter. An isolated plane of existence, riding the sunset above the clouds.
