Grabbed a quick breakfast. Finished up and submitted our micro homework. The Bhagavad Gita as an ego-superego interaction. Invest in memory keys. Bedbug’s *Pack Your Bags the Soul is Growing.* Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe. Caught up on the Phaedo during Micro. Went back to North and napped. Got dressed. Ran over to Booth for pitch day. Had a room hiccup with Sliced Bread. Exodus to Bartlett. Onboarded Courtney as our director of social media. Snowing out as we ran over to the firebird AOTY party. Told David Lara the story of Firebird and Alia. Invited him up to North and made eggs. Lot’s of fun things this weekend—puppet fest confirmed by Jay Kelly. Fog outside our window, stared into nothingness.

We’re connecting with so many people in such meaningful ways. Been so busy. Meetings back to back to back. Scheduling our lunch and dinners around people. Focus on our classes and plan towards our future—apply to jobs with our trackpatch stuff\!

“Will not that man reach reality, Simmias, if anyone does?” Phaedo 66a.
