Woke up. Left for class. Baker—feasted on tahini-naan-chicken. Spoke with Erica about Mao. Meritocratic checks and balances. Great leaders: Luke Delaney, Will Hu. Moved our meeting with Katy. Exercise attention control. Slept and felt positively terrible. Got up and went to SB. Fire Escape. Fourth Meal. Day saved?

Our goals remain the same: 
eat well, stay clean.
Trying out this new thing where we go to lectures and actually listen.
