#### Must Do's

6:30 wake. Waved Mom and Chloe bye. Won't be seeing them until end of summer? Uncle Jeremy arranged for Marcel to pick us up. Drove us down to Gambir Stasiun. 7 hour train ride. Finished the bag of food mom left us. Read through a couple hundred pages of Steve Job's biography. Outside, rice paddies, terraced. Mosques, white and gold minarets. Lotus pond. Passed mountains. Overwhelmingly green. A million little birds fly out. Mount Merapi in slight haze. Arrived in Jogja by sunset. There's a metro here? Free palestine graffiti. City seems walkable. Settled in our hotel. Did pushups. Cleaned up our face and put on a shirt. Walked around the neighborhood. Universities. Wisma Bahasa about half a mile north. Ate twice. Indo food, then Uncle restaurant, ran by a young Jay, speaker playing Friday Chinatown-esque Japanese 80s disco. Really good vibes.

Wish there were more ginger snacks.
Wedang Jahe. Ginger shot.
姜还是老的辣.

To do:
- Pick back up our paper journal habit
- Aesthetic/ascetic summer

The image of a man moving through a set of blades
if he can make it through he will become a ray of light
