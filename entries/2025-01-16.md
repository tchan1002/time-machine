#### Must Do's
- [x] Consumer Research for Nowhere
- [x] Human Communication Readings

"Git commit glyph. Hopping mice." Lunch with Vanessa. Sold Katy on our garden idea. A new type of curated shopping experience. Goal next week is to work up a complete design brief: problem to insights to design to justifications. 10:30 interview with Blair Thomas secured for Monday. Lowkey excited for gamejam. Based Sliced Bread packetâ€”Herbivore Cheat Day. Showered.

How do we accelerate this winter, certainly not by sitting around and jerking off.
On the record is quite literal. 

 [[Nowhere Collective]]: 
Key learnings from existing Primary Customer Research:
1. OOAK: one of a kindness is king.
2. Experience of in-person perusal is huge to most people's experience of buying handmade goods  ([[CB]]: initial consideration)
	1. When shopping online, makers conduct extensive checks to if the item has good reviews, is local, is renewable, etc... (active evaluation + closure)
3. Most people buy items as gifts for others.

Extrapolate from the experience of being at a holiday market, so much of the joy comes from perusing and feeling like one "found" something just for them (or for a special someone). How do we replicate this experience digitally? How do we personalize? Instead of a search function, maybe one is presented with a gallery of x items that refreshes every day? Time sensitivity plays into loss-aversion and items "made just for you" would allow for market. Daily refresh would also give someone a reason to visit the app daily (a virtual holiday market that someone can check out everyday)

Most minimally, a garden is a curated newsletter, maximally, it is an extension of one's personality.

[[Human Communication]]: 
thumbs up + thumbs down = thumb in the middle? it's a king - man + woman = queen problem. can we map asl onto a vector field?

Language is one of our rare windows into others. So what does it mean when "non-others" (AI) hijack this conscious melding stream. Do we fear the false soul?

Personal AI agent management systems may be next the big thing. Steve jobs + Xerox Park. Think AI + intelligent homes. 

Realization in our way of serendipitous input collection (especially our web-surfing behavior): inputs have different weights depending on the time that they're fed to us. e.g we don't think a lot when we first encounter a Virgil Abloh quote, but then we think about how it relates to our consumer behavior class, and then we watch a video about Kanye.
