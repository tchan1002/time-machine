Grabbed brunch at Baker. Caught up with Pedro at the pasta bar. Went to our religion class. Reach out for the Japanese House. Thanksgivingâ€™s coming up really soon. Published our photos. Stayed in our room. Slept. Get on things. 

Doctrine: Deformity of the body scares us because it threatens our definition of the human. So much so that one can drown an infant by claiming it to be a baby hippo. (c.f Mary Douglas)

Look into star wars costumes. The rags, so early christian.
