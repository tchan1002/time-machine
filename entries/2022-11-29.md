Woke up and did our math hand-in. Had lunch with Fredric. Sat down and composed our last close reading in the reg. The Farewell, Lulu Wang. Went to our lecture on Machiavelli. Nap time. Mock practice. Ethan and objections. Mind-composed our Omeros essay on the walk back to ihouse. Raining out. Heated up momâ€™s curry chicken. Watched Better Call Saul. 

We arrived godless, memories severed.  
Starting on a new page. Old doc was tiring out. Translation: lagging.
