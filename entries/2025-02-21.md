#### Must Do's
- [x] CB Prompt
- [x] [[No Leftovers]]

 Finished Sirens of Titan during breakfast. Went by Logan to pick up tripods and SD cards for Moda. Sent in our belated CB prompt en route Union Station. Media Station. Surveyed "attractive people" with Colin. Talked to Aiden Silvestri, who’s visiting his sister for the weekend. Got frustrated with Otto over sorting SD cards at show's end. Saved by Portillo’s at 11:00. Parth, Mikhail, Maanav, Mella and Hung. PMM helped us carry our setup. 12:05, stopped by Colin's afterparty. Observatory @ 1338 W Fulton Street. Will Hu, a Hansie from New York, and Leo. Lyfted back with Justin. Late night talk with Adah. On fumbling. 

Cool to know that Aiden Silverstri thought we were high-achieving. He spoke to us about our linkedin post this summer.

Think our biggest mistake over the course of our uchicago career was quitting mock trial—because we thought we were bigger than gossip. Maybe these are inevitable frictions that come with an involved community.

Question for us now: are we missing out on critical social connections because we don't drink/smoke/stay up late?

Lessons from Will: persistence, intention, and care are guiding principles. 
If you care about it make it happen. Devil's in the details—the dogtags.
