Day 87  
Meeting with Lara and Clark tomorrow instead. First gig came through. Welcome home, Son. Canoe. About an hour of our time? Hope this isn’t sketch. Up our price to $100. Songs I Can’t Listen to by Neon Trees. Made breakfast. E-cyrano's in the age of digital nomads. Shayna Beymer? Our new advisor. Suns out.  Cut down on the snacks. Eat some real food. Clinton Kane. Freshened up. Get outside. Save the day. Cut it short a little today. Lower calves felt sore. Fireflies. Showered and made dinner. Mieko Kawakami. Drunk Crabs. Getting indoctrinated into the org. Elite prep vietnam. Getting connected to Sasha Orama at NYU. Call mom about it. Sightread Greek with Jasper. Lycurgus allowed kids to remedy their hunger by stealing. Make cabbage tomorrow.

“Serve the lord in fear and report to him trembling.”  
“Do not be a lion in thy house”  
ὀφθαλμὸν ἀντὶ ὀφθαλμοῦ, ὀδόντα ἀντὶ ὀδόντος

Your strawberry tongue.
