Woke up at 3:30 and picked up our laundry. Lyfted to Max P in the dark. The wind. Ubered with the team to Midway. Flew. Read infinite jest on the plane. Descended into the colour blue. Jacinta and Mr. Wrong Number. Laid over in Las Vegas. The Rockies. Thomas and Isabelle on the plane to Santa Ana. Took Jack’s uber to the Irvine Spectrum center. Walked through the Village. The California sun\! Had a very tomato lunch at California Pizza Kitchen. Maybe too happy. Fatigue caught up with us at the motel 6\. Took a nap before dinner. Walked with William. The moon was luminous. Picked up avocados and bananas for free from the 99 cent store. Talked to Ryan. Slept.
