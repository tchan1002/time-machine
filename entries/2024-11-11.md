Woke up and showered. More is asked of us. Had a clean kosher meal at Baker. Rice and eggplants. Colin texted if we'd cover a Windy Ventures event for $200 dollars. WHPK from 3 to 5. (we may have to hop out at 4). Watched [[Grizzly Man]]. Met up with Moranâ€”returned our camera to Logan. Stopped by WHPK. Chirag led the new DJ's on a tour. Met Ben, a UChicago Alumn and former WHPK DJ. Work kinks out before sunday show. Figure out how to work mics and the phone. BM shift. Dodgeball. Went out for a run. Sub 8 for 4 miles, not bad.

The game is being intensely thoughtful.
