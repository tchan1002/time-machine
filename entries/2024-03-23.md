Grabbed breakfast with Ha and Rachel. Audiobooks on Spotify. If everyday we just smile a little wider. Put listerine back in our hair. Week by week. Grinded out three hours in CSIL with Ashley. Made the Sliced Bread cover. Went up to 53rd with Ryan. Ate at eto’o. Was really decent. Bought a copy of We’re Not Really Strangers: consider it an investment. Called mom and dad. Had some huge meringues. Did 60 pushups—we were able to do 30 in a row today. 

Strength: took us two days to prep for an investment final we knew nothing about,   
we’re good at absorbing information. A little persistence will get us in time. 

Why business? Fear and enterprise. What’s the fear? Fear of not enterprising.   
If we think the meaning of existence is imposition on one’s environment.  
A mandate to act in imago dei. We will go nowhere with split forks. 

Dreamt that we were in the lobby of a building downtown. Had opened up our notebook to plan for consulting recruiting. Some guy dropped by and offered us some advice. We told him that we would not let him down.
