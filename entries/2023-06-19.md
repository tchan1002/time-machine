Day 81  
Got breakfast with mom and Chloe. Brought our clothes to the laundromat. Mom poured the detergent like a libation. R2A, set up office spaces. Submitted our confirmation to be on the Singapore Trek. Book flights by Monday. Visit the Chicago campus in Hong Kong. Did some pull ups. Watched the Trial of the Chicago 7\. Read parts of the Port Huron statement. Make good use of our Exeter alumni account. 

Memento: Always thought of summer as a time of death, of limbo, of the condensation of realities that suffocate us. Have to escape that mentality and realize that we can breathe.
