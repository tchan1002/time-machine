Register an insta for Powley. Had breakfast with Leena. Leena told us we reminded her of Holden Caulfield. America by Simon and Garfunkel. Night Owls this Thursday. Banshees of Inisherin. In the age of supernovas and mass extinction events. Photos of Shanghai. Caught up with Alex Valbuena at lunch. Ran into Gabby in the Stuart Cubicles. Walked her to Cobb. Huddled up in the basement of Gates-Blake. The dirty white tunneled walls and red pipes. Felt seriously awful. *Midway in the journey of our lives.* Went to our lab. Had dinner at Bart with Nicole and the TJ kids. Was raining quietly on our walk back home. 

Dreamt that we were married and had children. You had a daughter and I had two sons. We were out on the grass under a summer canopy.

Song: Sober to Death by Car Seat Headrest.
