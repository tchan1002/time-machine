Day 48  
Woke up. Brushed up. Did 30 push ups. Set out for Kwai Fong. Realized we misread the time. Arrived at the warehouse around 10\. Took home a couple cans of abalone. Had conveyor belt sushi for lunch. Ice cream puffs. Watched Barbie. Greta Gerwig. *Only within the warmth of your gaze.* Went home. Funicular railcars. Copium. Went out for a run. Did a 3 miler down by the harbour. Showered and did our laundry. Itâ€™s a new day. 30 more pushups. Oppenheimer in Japan. Art films. Hanging out with some UChicago kids tomorrow. The Pandoran Biosphere. 

Snippet: The Navi. Dream walkers, demons in false bodies. Are we becoming them or are they becoming us? Always back to Avatar. Thinking about the natives. The question of erasure. It's a culture war. 

Snippet: *A lamentation for this city.* Our aunt, talking in a conspiratorial tone about companies moving out of Hong Kong. A geopolitical fault line. The top 1% make 47 times more than the bottom.

Snippet: Went out for a run. Lost ourselves in the silence of the city again. The crescent moon parked on Bailey street. Reduced to a thin streak by the warped mirror of an office building. Taxi Driver. Wong Kar Wai.
