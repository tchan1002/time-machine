April showers bring May flowers. Chloe. This side of paradise. “Our flaming youth”. Golden Slumbers by Thomas Decker. Went to breakfast. Lepidopterology. 24 pages to go in Hocus Pocus. Finished Hocus Pocus. The number was 82\. Almost Maine. Goel has some nice couches. Meeting for MTG. Sent a few emails about the calligraphy stand at Asian Carnival. Get out and run again. It’s been a fine day. Took a fat nap on the long rectangular couches. Do our Rushdie reading. Show up to the Architecture club at 5\. Ran into Rosen and Catherine on the red couches in the music building. Ryan joined us. The Trilogy. Carpe mensem. Don’t feel too bad about Jacqueline. Senior Assassin? Take from UTL for the Sibley? Ekphrasis. Principal's day. Made water and noodles. Talked to Chloe briefly. Common room might have a bit of an ant problem. Saturday sun. Ocean Vuong. Hang out. We did a good job of that. Proctor selections tomorrow. Sat for a good bit outside. Moved to the newsroom. Brittle bones. Apotheosis. Elephant graveyard. A post for the week. Jeremy Zucker. Scared. Odd weekend. Two things for the upcoming week: drink water and run. Also we have to grab shower supplies. Howl’s moving castle. Get the CSO event resolved. Bibliomaniac. We’ve come a long way.
