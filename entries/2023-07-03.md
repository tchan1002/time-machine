Day 67  
Checked out Franz Kafka’s diary. An interesting character. To write so personally with such intensity. Aboo brought us coconuts. Write people postcards. Had noodles for dinner. Did pushups. Sweat drenched, we cried. Went out for a night run. Stray cats. From the hilltop, a view of the city. Not a fan of how the heat grinds us down. Been upset with how little we’ve been able to do. Got back home and showered. Flying to Bangkok tomorrow. 

A step above Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. 

Meta: Went on a deep dive through our journal entries. The past is a bit more distant than we remember. A lot of the sentences are malformed, the belief in our always-consciousness may be a retroactive insert. We were slouching towards Bethlehem to be born. An awkwardness to be confronted with the unadulterated intensity of youth.
