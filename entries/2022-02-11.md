Got an email back from Emilio. Itâ€™s Michael not Jack. Burial of Jesus. Wordle was ulcer. Get shreked. The Passion of Christ. Went to Kirtland, played mafia. Had a good time in grill with Gretl, Oscair, Amber and Indigo. Dinner 7:30 tomorrow. Keep end in sight. Izzy and Serena in Chicago. Ecce homo. 

In the garden of Gethsemane we saw the moonlight  
And the suffering that was love.
