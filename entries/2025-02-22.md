9:30 back at ihouse. RA interviews. Meet and greet. Walked back north after noon. Had lunch with Dani. Holden came down for ethics bowl. Sat in on a round in Harper. Stopped by Elektra's to give her our ssd. Go to bed. A lone siren. Visited Parth's for photo equipment. Via'd back home, strapped.

Last hurrah.

He came from paradise and abhored how we treated the animals.
Wave to cars, open doors for othersâ€”these are the little stitches in the fabric.
