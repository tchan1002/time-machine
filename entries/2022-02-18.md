Greeted by heavy rain when we woke up. Had breakfast with Andrew and Andrea. Lost the wordle to “dodge”. Mondrian, The Singularity. Thoughts muddied lately. Take some time to refocus. Get out to run, come back and shower. Did a two miler. Get hydrated. Had eggs. Take time back tomorrow.

What if we took to the stage with our fantastic displays, our eyes in the sky like crosses.
