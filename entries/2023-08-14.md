Day 25  
Saw a really pretty girl on the train?\! Met Dad at 上水. Shenzhen. Ate. 西北涼皮. Went for a massage with dad. Masseuse went hard on the neck. Ran errands, applied for a new number. Sorted out bank stuff. Returned to Hong Kong by train. Read Kafka on the Shore en route home. Raining mackerel and sardines, a scene reminiscent of Magnolia. Bad Space Comics by Scott Base. Orange pilot jumpsuits.
