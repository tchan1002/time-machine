Hamburg to Berlin. Finished the Alchemist on the bus. Baltazar gave it to us to read. 170 pages went by fast. Nothing out of the ordinary, but good reminders. Weakness in our limbs. Berlin, Doner #4â€”the kebabfleisch this time was really airy and nice. Visited HitMarkt. Bought some kinder chocolates. Watched madmen with Baltazar.
