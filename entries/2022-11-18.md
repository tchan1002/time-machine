Snowfall in the night. Woke up and zoomed in to Ling office hours. Did well on our third pset. Inside job. Free tickets to Dante 360? Group work in Greece and Rome. Judith and Holofernes, Gustav Klimt. Intersubjectivity. Consolidate our essay idea, Aeneid and Omeros: Conceptions of the Underworld. Thanksgiving plans: Trip to the field museum? Thanksgiving Hit List. Typed stuff up in the reg. A level’s desolate today. Take more pictures. Drew for Boba. Stopped in the Reynolds club. Inched our way towards ihouse. Called Max. Tabula Rasa. Write a state of the union once quarter is over. Golden Hour. Moon River by Jacob Collier. Had dinner at Tiffins. Read The Moon to Richard. Sent Jacqueline what we wrote. Sushi and 冰紅茶. 5 centimeters per second, Makoto Shinkai

Doctrine: On Ghosts. Exterior representations of interior motivation. A reflection of conscience. *Co-science*, shared knowledge, because the dead are alive in the minds of the living. Like Hamlet's father, like patroclus’ ghost. To enter the water’s cold depths, the underworld. *Facilis descensus averno.* The dead bear witness like the creatures of the sea.

Meta: The metacognition is especially intense today. Musing a lot about musing. A soul searching. What is a life? Hit 200 pages.

Song: Home by Edward Sharpe.
