Day 63  
Woke up. Met Sunny at his hotel. Took a grab car to the Klong Toey slum. Pulled up to the Mercy Center. Took a tour of the place. Had lunch at Silom. Green curry with fermented rice noodles. Paper placemat resembling a banana leaf. Visited the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Center with Ashley and Olger. Big fish swallowing small fish. A three-dimensional street scene. A map reminded us of Noah. Returned to the hostel for a quick nap. Phil, our roommate in flannel shirts, moved out. Vergil from Shenzhen moved in. Ashley and Olger went to watch a Muay Thai fight. Had dinner at the Siam Paragon with Sunny. Walked around Sala Daeng as we looked for a foot massage, past go-go bars. Solicited by women on the street. Solo night ride through Bangkok. Met up with Ashley and Olger at Khao San road. Danced at the Bucket. Sipped on a coconut. Made moves, fumbled. 

Snippet: Nit and I did not understand each other by the barrier of language, but with how she was putting full force on my calves and quads, she must have been saying “god, this guy’s quads are huge.
