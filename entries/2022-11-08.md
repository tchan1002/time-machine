Had breakfast. Turkey bacon and oatmeal. Cui bono? Submitted our close reading in the reg. Read Omeros. Snuck in our Sosc writing workshop. Clutch. Just enjoy linguistics. Ate at the Halperin Table with Jake again. Box game. Big Rock Defense Theory: Danny the Saboteur. Outside of Cobb, the moon like an iris. Went to fourth meal. Took a lyft back. Look at internships.
