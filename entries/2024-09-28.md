Rodrigo and Sho came in the morning to pick up their stuff. Declutter. Script review meeting. Put sliced bread intros together. We actually have stuff to show for our presentation. Lunch with Anderson, Ryan and other incoming freshmen from Exeter. (That place now feels distant). Ran into Aviral. Helped Billy move in. Good to see people we know again. Museum of Science and Industry. Alex Odel. Coal mine tour was fire. “Longwall shearers can go for 70 to 90 million dollars”. Ice wall. Played pool with Lola. 

Grab dinner with Finn.  
Dorm room interior design. Actually just feng shui.  
Pet shrimp? We want to make this place nice.   
Hypersomnia.
