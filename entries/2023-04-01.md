Woke up. Felt the rain chilled earth. 宋冬野. Met Jack Monday and Rohan at Woodlawn. A literal etymology for money laundering. Clancy and Aidan. Worked on a crossword puzzle waiting for the bus. *Four point plays*\! Arrived in Chinatown via the red-line. Rick joined us at the restaurant. Numbing szechuan spice. Had the intestines and chilled chicken noodles. Cormac McCarthy’s The Road. *The heart is a fist wrapped in blood*. Stopped at the Asian grocers. Large bottles of Calpis. Walked to Clancy’s house in lakeview, behind the Big Jewel. Chicago classics. Watched Birdman in Clancy’s basement. *Song of Solomon*? San Diego State buzzer beater. Had Indian for dinner with Steven and Abby. Headed out in the blue night. Took an uber back. *City of dreams*. Went to Max P to watch Puss in Boots and an episode of Seinfeld. Vulvic flora. Walked back to ihouse under the cover of night.

Dreamt that we were in an Italian town, *Pergamo* (?). Lofty ceiling in the museum foyer, Roman room, train station. Saw an exhibit of red. Red carpet, gold sheathed rubies in glass cases. Left the museum and rejoined the tour group. Meteoric night, the sky was cleaved in two. We picked up loose stones in the town square.
