Slept till noon. Tiroâ€™s shorthands. Big Alaska. Moments of clarity on toilet seats. Think more. Zero in on our sosc paper for now. A day spent doing not much. Layed on the grass. Felt like Limbo. Hung out with Gabby in the ihouse library. Plans for an aquarium-home. Played protobowl with Will. Did quizzes with Phil and Sumin in the third floor lounge. Dub halloweekend. Wake up early and zone in tomorrow.

Memento: Mind, Body, and Soul. Abstain from dairy or fizzy drinks. Abstain from watching TV alone. Make time to run.
