Picked up our laundry. Had breakfast at Baker. Titus Andronicus. The Woods in Act 2\. Join the Dean’s Men in the spring? Fill out our survivor app. Ubloo creepypasta. Elephant dream god. Do our pre-reg. Figure out our course planning for an Econ major. Had dinner at Cathey with Hunter. Walked back to ihouse. To shave or not to shave? Slept. 

Snippet: There’s this guy who lives down the hall, paces down the hallway sometimes. His eyes look like he’s going to give out at any moment. Walks as if something drags him forward. He’s nice though. Curious thing—never says *good* when you ask *how are you*. *Alright*, *doing ok*, but never *good*.
