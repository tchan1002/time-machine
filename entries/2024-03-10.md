Linked up with Andre. Went up to Polanco for El Cardenal. Families grabbing Sunday brunch, dimsum-esque. Had concha and chocolate, then a chilaquiles rojos. So rich. Took an uber back. Love how the greenery meshes with concrete—and the graffiti\! Mom arrived. Street tacos. Went to the national anthropological museum. Saw the sundial and eight-fanged snakes. Ikker Larauri’s paintings. Went to Entremar. Tostadas de atun. Stopped by a Walmart for some groceries. Kefir. Walked much today. Evening calm, the purple Jacaranda trees.

Snippet: Morning the coffee shops and roads under canopy of trees. The dog walkers and runners and cyclists. Drivers only play 2010 hits.
