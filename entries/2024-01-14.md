Woke up. Ran over to Joe and Cristi’s. Tuesday Chef Toby Takeovers. Cleaned up our room. Changed out our bedsheets. Grabbed brunch with Corinne and Ann. Figure out this investment thing. Met with Lauren and went out to Shinju. Cold as hell\! Grabbed a second dinner at Baker. Got invited to a first round interview with DSP.

Maybe we change our strategy. It’s not about changing the mag but about just attaching a social backend. More events \+ open mics \+ formals.
