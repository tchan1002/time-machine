**Day 68**  
Feeling like a bit of a fuckup. Copacetic. Cleaning got us out of a ditch. Formatted our cavetown article. Culled pictures from last night. Picked up our laundry. Showered. Made beef noodles. Walked to Luke’s for rehearsal. Get the script down. Try to shoot something ourselves. Hung out with Rachel. Watched House of the Dragon. Made congee. Day of little tasks. 10 days till we’re one half through.

Something about ants.   
We’re like Steven Yeun in beef.
