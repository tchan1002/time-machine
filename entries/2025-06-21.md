Leg cramp in the middle of the night. Tummy ache. First day of feeling not so good. Grabbed bread downstairs at the indomarkt. Eat clean. Walked over to Wisma. Commandeered Aceh to work. Ache subsided. Had lunch with Sarah at a vegan restaurant. Showered. Issey Miyake. Sudden rain, loud. Ramen + magnum was pretty good dinner. Met a German and an Indonesian guy who talked about race day tomorrow. Pushups. Called dad re:Schwarzman. Last time this year we were still in Chicago, had not set out on our trip yet.
