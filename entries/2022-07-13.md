Day 69  
Nice. Made Scallion Pancakes for breakfast. Take out the trash. Keep the water cycle going and the music playing. The origins of Mafia. Cleaned up our fridge. Packed things up for mom. Moved through EPVN drafts. Went out about a mile out to Cherry Hill. Got a closer look at one of the red lights. Eased up in case of plantar fasciitis. Pack and meet Arhon tomorrow. Unplugged the printer.
