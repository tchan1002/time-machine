Did our Rushdie reading. Don’t think class did though. A memory of upper spring, of Will Huang’s grilled sandwich in Grill, grilled on the spot and all. Got boba. Adopted a succulent. Typed out metic. Did our covid test. A city of thieves. Charles Ogletree. Midterms. Reverse Senioritis. We’re doing ok. Get calligraphy down. Hung out in the PEAN room with Jacqueline. Greek Herodotus Sight. Guy really threw his ring into the sea. Downloaded Herodotus from Hathitrust with our UChicago account. Had fries with Indigo. Senior game night. CCC Interviews at 7:50. Reading at grill. Sent CSO email. We’re company if we bring it. Studio Night. Finished our carving. Make an Ex Libris. Did interviews. The future rests in good hands. Shower. Get back on log tomorrow. Saturday will be a breeze. Wake up early and finish the Dawn. The Whole of the Moon.

Snippet: Now a solitary radio wave traveling to the infinite depths of the universe. Perhaps an alien race, one not unlike our own, will intercept it. Or perhaps it will go on lightyears before it dissipates along with the last remaining energy of this universe. An eternity will have seemed like a second between now and then.

Soul exiting the body. Sleeping till judgement day  
“We are one” a forbidden fruit. A conscience. 

“Ad caelum adiam, quod sum iocosus.”
