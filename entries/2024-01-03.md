Day 0  
Packed our things for a return to Chicago. Switched out the silicon covers on our earbuds. What a terrific break. Archie drove us to Bradley. Stopped at a McDonalds on the way to take a leak. Got started with Freud on the plane—what is this guy yapping about? Sufjan Stevens’ Chicago. Touched down. Met Tarek from Algiers, recommended us some Tajin from Morocco. 

Vergil and Homer have nothing on Freud.  
Two Vonnegutian pursuits.  
This year we are 20, and time will fly and devour us. 

Picked up dad’s camera a little more than three months ago to make use of photo passes. Started with concert photography, then we took pictures at events and headshots of our friends. 

Scene 1: the luminous world from which we came. a swirling cosmos, a star is cast  
Scene 2: the condensation of cold bodies, men imprisoned in the hollow prisons of our flesh  
Scene 3: divided we suffer the sins of loneliness and apathy  
Scene 4: we sign signs in the darkness, out of the unwavering light of our souls  
Scene 5: a transmission of consciousness, this is art, this is love, this is humanity\!  
Scene 6: the great reunion, a merge, a neon genesis.
