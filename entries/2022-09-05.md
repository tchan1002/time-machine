Day 15  
Woke up and washed the dishes. Dattebayo. Game day tomorrow. Protobowl. Le good strikes again. Time immemorial. Anomie. Durkheim. Pack for New York. Went through our college health training. Alcohol education still to go. Went out for about a mile. Walked back in slight rain. Amer’s diner. Watched Whiplash. Miles Teller. The La Brea Tar Pits. Wake up early, laundry, pack. Whiplash was something. An aporic ending well executed. The father’s eyes. Damien Chazelle. Our hematoma is almost gone. We’re in good shape.

La La Land.
