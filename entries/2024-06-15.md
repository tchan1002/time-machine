**Day 97**  
Met Breno, a soon to be high school junior from Colorado. Talked degrees of difference. Father John Misty. Ran check-in with the RAs. Grabbed keys for people. On aux a hot sec. *Afterlife by Benee.* Ran by Jewel-Osco for supplies. 5 dollar shrimp. Honey butter toast then steak. Tried a butter soy combo. Yum. Dropped by work again. Made another Jewel-Osco run with Nolan. Chinese enchiladas? Had pasta and watched some Jubilee.

Man behind in the jewel-osco line offered to pay for us when he saw that we were struggling with our coupon. “I remember what it's like to be a student.” that sort of empathy, even when you’re stuck in line and reasonably frustrated.

Ground beef, sliced cucumbers, lettuce, and green onion wrapped in rice paper, served fresh or fried with a peanut vinegar dipping sauce. 

Writing culture among our friends. Wabberjocky coded.  
*Tantae molis erat Romanam condere gentem.* Ae. 1.33

From Sarah: Woodlawn’s not like the other dorms. A management company leases out the rooms to the school. Bedspace determines revenue, and so communal spaces become dead space.
