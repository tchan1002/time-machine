Woke up. Ran over to bart. Had our editors meeting. A coxswain metaphor, leadership is about bearing the onus when others fail. *When the rowers stop*, *you get back in the boat and row yourself.* Sent Serg, Nicole and Adama their photos. The changing colours in the sky. Our arms still so sore from carrying the PA on Friday. Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Went down to baker for some food. Ate with Tia then Aiden. Stranger challenge. Getting a customized chef Toby hat\! Our fire escape films sweatshirt so clutch. Learn how to use a flash. Got really tired, slept.

The urge to write things down, because we are too passionate about the self, too unyielding against time, too scared of being forgotten. We have enough material to construct a decent simulacrum. But what does that do? Realized recently that the trick is to do the things we love and do them well. There will always be value in treating people earnestly and holding those we love close to us. We were a jealous kid—on a car ride back from Roy Baek’s house we cried over his little white dog Momo and a prayer before dinner. We’re older now and know it’s on us to make things happen.
