**Day 35**  
Set out from the hostel at 6\. Caught a bus to Emeryville. Our train was much delayed. *We’re a damn sad fella, cried on the train out of Frisco.* Ian, ecologist, riparian, wetlands. Many got off at Reno. Read On the Road. Helped out an old marine headed to the VA office in Salt Lake. We’re a dangerous kind of idealist. Texted Clara. Read Consider the Lobster. In the early morning we’re projected to cross the Utah desert. Night, no stars, streetlights.

“Mike Canine.” Sal Paradise.

It had been two years since I last saw Will Park, which coincidentally, was the same amount of time for which I had not seen my father.

All you can do on a train is think. Like what am I even doing here? Do we listen to other people’s music to approximate headspace? Consider the Lobster: the real problem is we don’t think—DFW is so naive in thinking we think that it hurts. We’re just inhuman sometimes like that. Kill the whale\!
