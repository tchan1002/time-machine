Up at 6:30. Showered. Let’s work. Grabbed two cakes on our way to Interviewing. The Canadian film board’s *ZEA*. It’s all a matter of perspective. Spent the day building a linktree clone for app dev. Met up with Simon at Bart. Today was rough. Left App Dev just to sleep in Booth. Packed up our things. Stopped by Bartlett. Had dinner with Ryan and Isabella. Was really nice to see them. Be less weird. Stopped by Moda. Get to know Will Hu. Sliced Bread. We know where we’re going, take a step back. 

Some real fatigue today—could be our vegetarian diet. Our eyes feel like they're about to pop out. But we’re alive, at least.

Amigo: Marketing. Keep ITYSM a closed club. People have to get an ITYSM to start sending out ITYSM’s of their own. Creation of a lineage? We can track lineages based on keeping a record of who sent whom ITYSM’s when.
