Ask the health center for allergy meds. Daniel supplied us. Benadryl should last us a while. Busy day tomorrow. Dinner with McLaughlin. To curse the rising suns. Avatar sequel? Probably not gonna go for the poetry prize, after all we’re a prose writer. Ted talks out. Took a benadryl. Experiment to see how we feel tomorrow. Tin foil hats. Probably the worst first impression we could make at college. Welp. Desmond emailed us, guess silence is not a plan. Wrote email back to Desmond. Desmond honestly a goat. Think we can nail our Ted Talk. Degeneration of thought? Today feels weird. In stark contrast. Kill them all. Assassins in its final stages.

Wake up and read stardust.

Writing bonanza tomorrow  
Pick back up on Greek. 

Memento: Two things that we’ve established as real shames. Not seeing our friends and not exercising our body.
