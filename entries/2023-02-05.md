Woke up at 6:30. Packed. Left our Exeter sweatshirt at a McDonalds—Iowa will have a piece of New Hampshire. Closed by-busting. Pulled a damning 702 on the opposing side’s Heisman. *Morgan Felder clutches the edge of his seat.* Team won the last bid. Had a snowball fight with Sam and Ethan. Lunch at Culvers. Spicy chicken sandwich and a caramel concrete mixer. Played hide and seek in the world’s largest truck stop. Sunset on I-80. The cake-like moon over Iowan fields, the bluest night. Pablo Neruda’s Love Sonnet XI. Stopped for dinner at Buffalo Wild Wings. Fried pickles and Carolina reaper wings. Coach Sam can take the heat. Kevin Tong called. *Do you remember when we took our shirts off?* 1980s Horror Film. Got dropped off at IHouse. Ran into Jack Archer, Dellara and Clancy down at Tiffins. Missed the I-Hunction over the weekend. Characters of UChicago. Walked with Clancy to Bartmart for milk. Saieh in the night. Lesbian love songs. Catullus 63, giving up the life root for a religious love. Surrendered to sweet sleep. 

*When we were just two freaking out on some motel stairs.*
