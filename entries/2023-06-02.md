Day 98  
Took the train to Hakone. Texted Olger, plans for a summer in Hong Kong. Zigzagged up Mt. Hakone, the roads winding. *Tozan*, 登山, mountain climbers, *gli scalatori*. Raining hard in the mountains. A short foot bath before we returned to Hakone-Yumuto. Ate at Yamasoba. Ukiyo-dons. Red bean buns. Hydrangea and moss growing on rocks. Volcanic origins of onsen towns, the sulfur in the hot springs. Rain falling like in Weathering with You. JR announcements audible from our room at the hostel.  

Snippet: When we arrived at the hostel, past the variegated shades of green, the manager greeted us. He told us it was the hardest he’s seen it rain in a while. The torrential downpour nourished the mountain greens. The verdant patches.
