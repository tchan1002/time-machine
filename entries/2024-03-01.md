First of march. Talked to Katie, met Bethany. Plans for a Sunshine Action-Career Advancement collab this Spring. Attended a virtual press conference with A24’s Julio Torres. Went down to Booth for the CNVC finals. Fugue state, hit the road. Ran and went for a swim. Attempted fourth meal. Chance meetings and little talks. Ended up grabbing an almond croissant and hot chocolate at Pret. Lynkr won big today. Helped Arhon with the rest of his essays.

Start running and reading again.

No marketable skills but we’re persistent, bold, and hungry. We side quest. We outreach, we take new paths. Disappear a couple years; come back a millionaire. James Gatz.
