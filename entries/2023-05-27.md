Day 104  
Woke up at 10\. Restructure run to tonight. Truffles for breakfast. One narrative, tell human stories. Went to Chloeâ€™s baccalaureate service. Balms and Psalms. Career trek. Watched a documentary on micromouse. Progress depends on paradigm shifts. Got a New York Times subscription through Chicago. 

How does a man make himself eternal? Become impressive over this summer by working on projects. Produce, produce, produce.
