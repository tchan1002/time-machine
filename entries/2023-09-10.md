Got breakfast. Went to our storage unit. Brought back our stuff. Packed our room. Did our laundry. Left for Hyde Park Produce. Gorgonzola and bread. Dinner at Woodlawn. Mark and Giancarlo. Cicadas. Threw a frisbee around the quad. Picked up the toiletries we left at Elijahâ€™s. Picked up our laundry. Put our sheets on. Put the blanket on the floor. Room is complete. Someplace a man can live. 

Ego death.   
Human is emotion articulate.
