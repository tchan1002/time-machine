Went out to breakfast. Saw Phil Horrigan at frisbee. Team 6\. Daria and Yao. Had lunch with New York Alex. Skipped our mentor session. Took the metra to the Art Institute. Bat coin. Found Anne. Summer at the Arboretum. Nighthawks and American Gothic. To be a museum plaque writer. Orthodox iconography, Jesus decrepit. Art for a public purpose. Caravaggio. Engaged in some adequate nostalgia. The funneling of Exeter. The literary evangelism of David Foster Wallace. Ate from a food truck. Had our torta and one half of Anne’s burrito on a ledge. Anne drove us home. Sat together in the ihouse courtyard. *Illuminati not so far away*. Bid Anne goodbye. Night at the Museum of Science and Industry. Went inside a u-boat with Seth. Schweinboote. Walked back and watched Love Island. Davide, Spanish lover. 

The question now is whether or not this place (UChicago) is a unifying experience.
