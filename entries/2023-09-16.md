Called Dad in the morning. Went out to Trader Joes for groceries. Made noodles for lunch. Met Josie at True North. Mapped out plans for Sliced Bread. Moving Sliced Bread into the arts. E-board. Met Enzo at the bookstore. Josie gave him a quick tour. Assembled Exodia, made a 3x3 grid for sliced bread. Walked with Melody to Michael’s for dinner. The party: Megan Ding, Erik Ely, Hadley, and Rodrigo. Teriyaki Chicken Thighs—we should host some dinners. Walked back to North. Showered. Called Amber and Claire after missing their facetime. 

On Sliced Bread, *our competition sucks.* It’s crazy that there’s not a sizable publication dedicated to the arts on this campus. We can be the best.
