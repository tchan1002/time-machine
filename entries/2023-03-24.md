Grabbed a Tiffins breakfast. Big exam in the afternoon. Figure out integration by parts udv=uv-vdu. Figure out trig subs. Sang on our way to Cobb. Isabella’s in our political theory discussion. *People hate Rawls, but he’s our homie*. Went to Cathey with Isabella and Ben. Dopamine detox. 蓝莲花. *Feeling like a red-haired home say young from Squid Game.* Mark of the covenant. Settled in a Stuart cubicle. Ran into Tommy. Macro discussion canceled—earned ourselves another hour. Met with Sergio. Got ourselves some buns from the May *bunraiser*. Took our math final at Ekhart. Went to Target with Gabby. Bought eggs and cuties. Came back. Hung out with Mikey and Dellara. Made noodles, twin yolks\! Swam, tread water to build up our stamina. Reg, the always safe haven. Returned to IHouse, sat in Tiffins with Emily and Giancarlo. Had a mango agua fresca. Went to Dylan’s party with Dellara and Jack. Drunk matt. Moved to the Max P Function, Hatunction. Walked back with Clancy and Bill Baker.

Dream Song:  
The golden fibers of your irises  
In twin suns are made golden fires

Meditation: How neat it is that we are here in this cultural temporal niche where we read Shakespeare and listen to Saint Motel—and other people do too?

Snippet: Phantasmorgasm of fever. Repeated bouts of religious fervor. As if some rebirth, change in speech patterns. Rejuvenation of spring. A look through the pinhole afforded by a baptism of water and bleach. The golden hairs upon our head.
