**Day 76**  
Morning shift. Early start. Walked every floor of Woodlawn. Solo cups, spoils of war. Met Jake by the water fountain. Prep and get our permit tmr. Rocky is no mistake. Did a couple r/photoshop requests. Helped someone with their grad photo and a woman with her engagement photo. Made a dollar in tips. Went out to the point with the RAs. Made smores with Anna. Pop rock chocolates. Alice and Nat. Goofed. *Loneliest whale has a friend.* Jumped in the water. Juli had to pull us out. Maryanne—preached amigo (we still got it\!). Walked back and decided to fuck it. Ran 3 miles in our regular clothes. Showered. Laundry early tomorrow. 

Photoshopped godzilla. 

Been a weird summer (as all summers are). Haven’t left campus since it started. Our favourite pastime? going to Jewel Osco and buying the cheapest steaks to baste in kerrygold. Even got ourselves a thyme plant. We’ve been living like a real degenerate. And the mangoes. 16 for 6 dollars.
