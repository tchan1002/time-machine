Woke up at 6:00. Dominic Fike. Met with Holden for Breakfast. Sample Ted talks. The spice must flow. Returned our library copy of electric sheep. Slept for a bit in the library basement. Oulipo. Invisible cities. Chiltern classics. Dug through 40 pages of Rushdie. The Road. Did laundry. Sunroof under grey skies. Went through wikipedia pages for Certamen. History and Literature specialist? Cato the Younger. Had dinner with Amber and Claire. Cadbury eggs. Played the most epic game of 20 questions. The concept of fidelity. Talked to Arhon about college. We’ve come pretty far. Keep end in sight.
