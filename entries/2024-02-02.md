Woke up early. Took a shower and cleaned up. Walked down to Gates-Blake for our writing workshop. Plato’s Number. Grabbed breakfast with Thomas and his friend Evan. Caught up with Phoebe and then Bianca. Lunch with Clancy. Too many cups of tea. Met Skylar at Grounds of Being. Sat outside and got hit by a piece of bark. Smart museum tour. Got off the waitlist for Mexico\! Went by Crerar. Watched Skylar zoom in the Stuart cubicles. Went dumb a little bit. Lily-chou chou. Ran into Olivia Rae and grabbed dinner with Yuto. We could be on NHK? Say hi to the good people of Japan.
