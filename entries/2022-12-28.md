Day 5  
Texted Grace. Zooming Mark today at 5:30. Mock grind. Hit things running when we get back. Learn to voir-dire. Filled out the Fafsa. Alice in Borderland, Squid Game-esque? Met with Mark, sent him our RA recommendation request. Went out for a jog. Head out earlier tomorrow. The Stone of Scone.

Films: Avatar 2, Babylon, The Farewell, Guillermoâ€™s Pinocchio.

Dreamt that we lived in South, if South was somehow downtown and by Lake Michigan. Stumbled into a large catering room, then a climbing gym and a natural museum by the side of the building. Ran into Grace with her friends, who stopped to talk to us about Smith. Spilled some tteokbokki on her clothes, tried hard to wipe it off with a wet rag.
