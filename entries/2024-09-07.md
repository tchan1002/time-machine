**Day 14**  
Cleaned house. Took a lyft to union station. Slept on the train. Providence, RI. In Boston. The tunnel outside Back Bay. Real nostalgia for not having been here in years. Took the T from State to Chinatown. Pho with Zara, though only one bowl came and she really just watched us eat. Θαλασσα, Θαλασσα. Framingham. Worcester. Raining in Pittsfield. Took a good nap. An hour we have in Albany. Went to this little Korean cafe by the other side of the tracks, called s*on of egg*. Upstairs an event space. The rain is sorta beautiful here. Apt. Got ourselves some dumplings and eggs. Read Vonnegut as we passed Schenectady. Finished *if this isn’t nice, what is?* Picked back up Kafka on the Shore. Murakami is really unabashed when it comes to espousing his philosophy. 

Black friday: get ourselves a new phone and stuff.  
Human instrumentality project—one man’s vision of heaven—a mindmeld.   
We were raised by the great cynics.

入乡随俗.

Fugue. One time in the Bhaus basement, we freaked out over being cannibals. Daniel, Will and us. Said it was the deepest form of love. Not unlike the incest at the end of Arundhati Roy’s the God of Small Things.

Thomas: are the most interesting people in your econ classes?
