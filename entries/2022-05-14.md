Woke up to the gentle morning sun. Showed up to puzzlehunt. A flower crown and a fairy in a fairy house. Sticker Factory. Dear Mr. President by Peter Alsop. Salvator Mundi. The Decameron. Cataclysmic Aggressions. “Whither thou goest…” Finished Stardust on a library armchair accompanied by the lumineers. Visited the health center under suspicion of Covid-19. If we do go in, do pushups and just take time to read. Have plenty to write between “the Eye” and Miranda v. Arizona. Came back all negative. Did our due diligence. Finished our Rushdie reading. Phantasms of the Sundarban. Walked to Walgreens with JF. The Colophon Bookstore. Stumbled onto a Banh Mi operation in the church basement. Idylls of the King. See if we visit the Colophon again with Holden this weekend. Ivan Bilibin. Koschei the Deathless. Took a nap in the heat. Set up the calligraphy stand at Asian carnival. City of Stars. Jacqueline taught us how to make a piano. Brunch with the Ted team tomorrow. Take allergy meds in the morning. Shower and go to bed. Beyel and Stendhal. Boris Zvorykin. Book illustrations. Visit the art library. A long text from Jacqueline.
