Day 10  
Rested our eyes. Read a little of Murakami’s *What I Think About When I Talk About Running*. Had some mutton chops. Packed gifts. Wrapped ourselves up. Took a nap. A 3-year plan for Sliced Bread: from a club to an artistic revolution on campus. *Mind dwelling, softly reminiscing.* Scarlett Johanson in A24’s Under the Skin. Heading out to New York tomorrow. Finished our writeup of FESAP, submitted to Fire Escape. Finally got to making our mini vlogs—Singapore career trek and last day in HK. Uploaded a short to our youtube channel, Toby Cosmos. Look into enlarger lenses. Packed our things for tomorrow.

20, two decades of us. In the rare temporal niche of this 21st century… in an exceptional company of people. Composites of composites. Would be wrong not to share what we are so grateful for. 

Photoprompt: faux film stills with subtitles, triple scenes stacked on top of each other.   
Photoprompt: multi portraiture of people in their dorm rooms.

Film: One night in Browning, alternate futures. Will Park, Daniel and Us. One to New York, One as a writer, one filmmaker?
