Morning. Skated over to lab. Returned our stuff to Logan. Three tripods and an Amoran. Carry the crossâ€”cf Minari. We're missing a 32gb sd card. Stopped by Cathey for a cup of tea. Walked back north with Yuna. Meeting with Joe and Cristi. Worked on Who's On.  Had dinner with Bianca. Good to have people to look up to. Big back. Sandos in the house. Went out on a run. Up the parking lot. Showered. Good day.

Return to the road. Aint that neat.

Desiring some flagellation from our god
Life and death are absolute positives. 

[[Who's On?]]
What are we excited to learn about from Colin and Diego?
They are masters of working with people and founders. They are intent on building a community
We've read both people's mediums.
