Day 2 of being comfortable with filming ourselves. Marked out our day on Tweek. Grabbed smoothies at the Dean Commons. Grabbed lunch at Baker. Cleaned up our room. Stop the rot\! Listened through the Lumineers’ debut album. Made pasta for lunch. Called Josie. Made pasta for dinner. Made pancakes. Finalized our metcalf stuff. Go thrifting sometime for new digs—make purchases of audio visual equipment. Do our pushups. 

Scoured Excel. Use the Exeter directory to find people. Warner Bros.

We need to work on voice and presentation.   
The formula might be about getting jacked.

For fear of elevator doors closing like jaws of death. Vitruvian man.  
Song: Dead Sea by the Lumineers.
