Breakfast at Baker. Sloth is sin. Read Kafka on the Shore. Listened through Ichiko Aoba's Windswept Adan. Was reminded of the rocks by Shek O beach. Water pooled in shallow crevices, little fish and crabs. Ran into [[Vanessa]] at the A level. Watched Submarine (2010). Grabbed lunch with Vanessa. Had some drunken noodles at  noodles etc. Moved to Baker and read some more. Caught [[Christina]] at [[Veronica]]'s. Dinner. Time did skip today, and we fugued (which really means we felt lonely)

We really ought to read some Chinese novels. Went down a rabbit hole on contemporary authors and began to wonder why Chinese literature is not huge globally? Japan's got Mishima, Murakami, Ishiguro. Heck, breast and eggs too. 中国的文艺青年在哪里？

Watch submarine (2010)
