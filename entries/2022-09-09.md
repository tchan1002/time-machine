Day 11  
Woke up and visited NYU law. Had a double shackburger and a strawberry shake. Left with Nicole to Moynihan Train Hall. Talked while waiting for our trains. Cried to this Side of Paradise. Ran into Siona by Yale’s Old Campus. Met up with Daniel. Ate at Branford college. Modes of social interaction: in college, reconnection over maintenance. Life after the garden of Eden. Took the bus home. Found out who’s behind Exeter compliments. 

Stuck in the purgatory of summer.  
Daniel: how much of home is 14 to 18? 

Song: This Side of Paradise by Coyote Theory.
