Breakfast. Took headshots for HKSA at Saieh. Made 75 bucks. Went to dinner at Hutch. Cobb Cafe with Kofi DJing. Went to Clancy’s bday in the IHouse homeroom. Lots of our friends. First time seeing Gabby in a while. Mr. Fantastic Fox. Apple Bottom Jeans by Bob Dylan. *We maintain friendships of intention by making them friendships of convenience.* Walked back with Corinne. Stayed up with Jackie and Vanessa. We are a solitary beam of light. 

It was as if the raw image was just a set of bones; and our editing, manipulations of a malleable flesh. 

Zane’s recs: Talking Heads, Blind Guardian, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Agalloch
