Late alarm. Stuffed our mouth with toothpaste and walked to our linguistics section. Canyon moon. 枯藤老樹昏鴉. Had a big breakfast at bart. Filled out our Agenda. Baker with Jack Archer. Carnival cookie, s'more smoagie. Writing seminar. Went back to ihouse afterwards and packed. Printed Mock materials out at the reg and got on Steph’s car. Long car ride. Arrived in Indiana, back in EST. Stayed up until two to prep. Just like our old MUN days. 

Grey vines, old tree, sunset crows  
Flowing water, chimney smoke.   
West wind, tired mule on an old town road.  
The sun sets at the edge of the world.

Song: I Won’t Give Up by Jason Mraz
