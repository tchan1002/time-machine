Day 100  
Woke up early in the morning. Flat wide eggs. Coolcatteries and the expanding tobiverse. Uncle drove us around Long Island. Checked in at JFK. Wrote cover letters on the plane to Haneda. Six hours in, the Yoke Lore mix proved to be a golden playlist. Watched Matrix: Resurrections. In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. 

Snippet: A close-up shot of a termite mound over desert sands, transitioning to that of the tower Babel. 

Song: Silver Lining by Mt. Joy
