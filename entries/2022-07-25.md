Day 57  
Boston. Woke up to a sunrise over a grateful universe. Went down to the airport. How limited close-framed television will seem in an age of virtual reality. The value of microinteractions. Gianluca. Five ages of man. The song has existed far longer than the word. Had Jersey Mikes and a Mango Jamba Juice in Charlotte. Jasper filled out a suspicious survey. Picked up Will Turner. Touched down in Louisiana. Arrived one hour faster by the clock. Regis, our uber driver, gave us a warm welcome. Checked in and found Holden and Kiesse. Checked into the dorms and went straight to the Olympika swim. Met brother Aife. Beat Gianluca in the 50 breaststroke and exhausted ourselves in the 200 freestyle. First in the 225 though. Talked with Will Turner and Gianluca about Chicago. Find Matt Turner. Explored lifepaths. GRIOT. Teach at Dartmouth? Gladiator Pool Noodle Freeze Tag. Pink for life, pink in my veins. Absolutely demolished the children. The few against the many. Our harpooning skills. Met an alligator. Did not feed the alligator a Dorito. 

A universe lies in your natal eyes.
