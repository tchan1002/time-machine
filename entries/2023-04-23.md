Grind out. Weâ€™ll be done today. Had bread and cheese for breakfast. Watched Minari. Got an extension on our poli-sci paper. Made noodles. Udon from Tiffins. Sent in our application for Sunshine Action. Showered. 30 days till end of freshman year. Go get breakfast tomorrow.

Dreamt that school was in London and that the buildings on the quad led out to the street. A gathering storm at dusk. The uber driver took us up a big tree via a spiral car park, where we took shelter from the rain.
