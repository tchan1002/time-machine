Operation Gigachad before going to Chicago next year. Review math and study Greek. Talk to Nick and JF. Study French. Run and do pushups. Get gloves and pants.

Retroactive insert: Checked Fordham first, then Chicago. Was in our room and yelled fuck yes.  Didnâ€™t realize the window was open. Will Park happened to walk by. Max came into our room. Walked to dinner that night relieved.
