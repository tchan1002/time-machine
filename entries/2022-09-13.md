Day 7  
Midnight thunderstorms. Dreamt that we were in the rockies. Had talking pizza. Christ figures. The Seventh Seal. A star called wormwood. Absinthe. Kohler’s Medicinary. Henri Rousseau’s lions. Returned to the road. Ventured a little into West Rock. Rain pouring on the asphalt. A buddha’s palm in the clouds. True light of the world. Forgot how good running is. Get out there again tomorrow. Talked briefly with Will Park and Danielle. Blazons, archetypes of concise and precise language. Mr. Langford liked our story. Joined Batraxoi’s discord for Athenaze chapter 2\. Illustrated John in Greek. 

“This happy breed of men, this little world, this precious stone set in a silver sea.” Richard II.
