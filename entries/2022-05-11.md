Alex Rosen’s jug. Allergies feeling better? Last day to work on the Dawn. Took a fat nap. Advisory: a smile and a rhyme. Cohorts, dorm units, one-directional staircases. What the 20s must have seemed to the 60s, the 60s to us now. Midnight in Paris. The Dawn. Conscience as societal pressure. The danger of being at a lack of words. We’ve got a lot of time today. Rehearsal at 7. Worked on The Dawn and sent it in. Dinner and Ted talk. Joined Pinoy Society for dinner. Meteor Garden. Penultimate speaker. Feeling big dubs today. Review for Greek. The Colophon Bookshop. Went for a run. Felt good. Went down to Swasey. The night blue. The  Ted x program looks nice. Get back up there with the pushups. Look out for Greek. “Unhinged”. Operation Mincemeat. Make sure to do laundry. Golden fried rice. Separate yolk and egg white. The Pollenocalypse. 

Song: Oregon by Wabie.
