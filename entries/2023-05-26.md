Day 105  
Woke up early and drove down to Choate. Saw Chloe. Went to Chloe’s cum laude induction. Carried her beanbag back home. Thoughts on this summer: the beauty of authentically capturing a moment. Take up a camera, get a journal. Took out the trash and went for a walk. Dandelions falling like snow. We’re officially in summer, T-105 to RA training. Wake up tomorrow for an early run. Sam’s tailor? Watched a documentary on metamodernism in film. 

Summer projects:  
Homegoing travelogues  
Movie critic training.  
Planche training.   
Get a tailored suit.  
Go to one of the small islands of Hong Kong  
Conduct interviews with strangers  
Find scenes from your name in Tokyo. 

Memento: Depend on structural propositions—early morning 3 mile walks. Major emphasis on tobyvfitness activities, planche. General plot of the summer—Chloe’s grad, Japan, Hong Kong (internship), Shanghai, week in Connecticut before Chicago in September.
