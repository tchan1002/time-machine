Day 73  
Slept in. Can’t do that any more. Went for Dim Sum with Aboo and Gonggong. Took the train to the office in Central. Worked with Ulyssa to type stuff up for SunshineVerse. Listened to the Ballad of Cleopatra again. Levels of consciousness. Finished work. Wandered around Central with Olger and Ashley. Had some Rogan Josh at a really tucked away Indian place. Owner suffered a stroke, they were happy to have us. Beer on the house. Followed the music upstairs to Kimberly’s Lounge, a Filipino bar. Did a rendition of Fergalicious.
