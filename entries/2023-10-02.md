Woke up. Put on our clothes. Had a bowl of yogurt at Baker. Simpson’s paradox. Dropped by reg fest after religion. Felt awfully sad. Made a paper Rockefeller. Walked back to North and took a nap. Woke up to the afternoon sun. The edge of the sphere gleaming. May have fucked up looking at the sun through our viewfinder. Called Zara for an hour and a half. This saved the day—was nice to catch up. Slept.

“Have this picture, have this memory forever.”
