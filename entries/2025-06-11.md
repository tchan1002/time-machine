- [x] Book Schwarzman flights

Woke up at 7:30 to meet dad at a cafe near his place. French? Had a cup of tea. Met Uncle Charles and his little white dogs, 5 generations 正宗上海人, '82 UIC. Computers, bus boy, Exeter dad. Who's Shelley? She seemed nervous to meet us. Dad didi'd us to lunch with Mom, Aboo, Chloe. 片皮鸭. Went back with Aboo. Napped. Dinner and a movie. 九龙冰室，番茄牛肉通心粉，猎金游戏，刘德华. Good guys have to win. 中宣部. Mom and dad proposed chipping us for safety in Indonesia. Walked back. Ran into a incoming uchicago kid, class of 29, Jason. Filled out flights for Schwarzman. Reached out to Xavier.

Spend some good time with Aboo. Two months and we're back. 

History of world fairs. The changing architecture of American cities. Skycraper canopies force evolving undergrowths.
