**Day 77**  
Barely got out of our bed. Had breakfast. Squash out little tasks. Made lunch (honey pork). Made dinner (tomato giglis). Lost today to a depressive episode. Quit thinking about Gabby and that stuff. Returned texts. Clean up. Can’t let death win. Did 2 sets of 20 pushups. 

Call Chloe, get a flight to philadelphia.

If we can’t fix today, get an early start on tomorrow.  
Hack out some linkedin learning certificates. 

Song: Sunburn by Almost Monday.
