#### Must Do's
- [x] Run
- [x] Pushup-failure cycle

Slipped into a couple bouts of paralysis last night. Had a great talk with Kierran over breakfast. 1 of 10 siblings. Kierran wrestled senior year of high school. Faulty machines—Breakfast of Champions. MADD center. Build who's on website—stay up tonight if we have to. Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey. Cut our hair. Went out to run. Took a via back. Full moon. Stopped by Josie's to watch Submarine with Sliced Bread. Same problem we've been looking at. [[Substack]]. The fundamental unknowableness of other people. Midnight pancakes with Lola and Susan.

[[Who's On?]]:
Compile an investors page if we want to be the bottleneck.
Who's on? a crowd sourced fund.
Exercise for ourselves to go door-to-door to sell a product.
A symbolic $1 buy-in for investors.
