Day 38  
Read Murakami on the train to Kwai Fong. Moved bags at the warehouse. Sunny’s friend Richard took us to lunch in Sham Shui Po. 35 years an all you can eat BBQ restaurant. Olger liked the sago soup. Did work in Central. Worked on our Transwarp powerpoint. Never before this summer have we felt our destiny so intertwined with that of a city. Called Dad. Thoughts on One Belt One Road? Wouldn’t mind living in Southeast Asia. Our mango farm. 

Snippet: Karma is a round thing. *It’s not that I help you and you help me. It’s that I help you, and you pay it forward*. It goes in a big circle before it comes back
