Submitted our math homework. Walked to Bart for breakfast. Cold. Sat down and caught up with Calabresi. Settled into a reg cubicle. Rid our eyes of dark circles. Sent Stephen an email. Worked on our Moby Dick article. Early dinner at Bart. Went to our new lab section. Jacob from Gallo. Mock practice. Logged in to our RA info session. Worked on our crosses with Steph and Ethan. Stayed till 9:40. The air had become hostile, cold to the point of suffocation.

Snippet of a Reg Bathroom: U-shaped toilet seat. Ribbed grooves of mammoth teeth. Smiles scrawled on ceramic tiles.
