Woke up in the morning. Saw a nice picnic basket on marketplace. Skipped our stats class. Hung out on the quad with Misaki. Got an extension on our religion paper. Shopped Lekha’s Self class. Valbs. Arrived at Trott late. Went to the DSP event. Frozen mangos. Designer bootcamp—would be nice to know how to make clothes. Go to our stats workshop tomorrow night. Embody a persona.
