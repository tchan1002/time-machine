Defne from Blacklight. Worked on and submitted our DSP app. Made a playlist out of all the songs people submitted for Secret Santa. Napped and showered. Had Saturday night meal swipe. *The Theory of Everyone*. Dropped by DU with Anderson for some pizza. Lessons on shapeshifting. Walked Anderson back to ihouse. About Time. Grabbed a hibiscus agua fresca from Tiffins. Lyfted back and went to bed.
