#### Must Do's
- [x] Code actionable insights
- [x] Push out rise reforming article at 10pm 
- [x] Climb.

Recenter. Don’t think too wide. Code actionable insights. Go climb. Shut the fuck up about third spaces. Onespace. Took the train down to Shenzhen. An hour climb, an hour work. We did the white route but didn't have a recording of it. Stretch routine. Figured out how to integrate codex in our vibecode flow so we're not even opening up an IDE. Took the train back round 10. Called Will Hu for an hour, who's in New York making the decision we're going to make. His take was really: its just about maintaining the vibe. We learn by unlearning. The signal is culture. We have to be in it for the culture.

biotrigger: even a slightly warm room makes us tired and sleepy
our dreams of failure and death propel us into action.
all about presentation—think our big bread qr code. think about sushi gunboat.
people don’t care enough about us to remember our failures. keep relaunching.

We need to learn the reality distortion field.
Ernie's says we need to convince someone to:
2. fund the Jacuzzi in a Van idea
3. convince someone to quit their job/school and go build with us in new york.
The first step is never having any internal doubt.

AI is just the bedrock. The right integration, and where to integrate is key.
