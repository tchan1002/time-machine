Laundry. Went to lab. Egg salad panini. Berlin trek meeting. Slept for a sec. Showered. Picked up laundry. Cleaned up our email. Drifted through Baker, Bart, Baker. A couple glasses of honey and lemons. Still in a fugue state. Poncho and Lefty kind of night. Skated down to meet [[Mel]]. Sat outside Cathy for a bit. Ended up sitting and chatting at Midway Mart, like we had with [[Oia]] winter of our first year. Mel's brother, before Covid started, ran a platform called student chefsâ€”made restaurants out of apartments, a kind of third space. and Mel, during her gap year, walked the Camino de Santiago. Edited and published our observation on medium. We do love writing and should write more. 

Recs from Mel:

[WWOOF](https://wwoof.net/) (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms)
Spring complit course on time and death.

How we felt seeing the San Francisco Bay for the first time this past summer, carry that forward. 

We can be more comfortable with silence. Especially if its a nice moment.

Open AI was an Manhattan project. Altman said let's tap the top 50 guys at YC before google and meta get to it. Find the [[Short List]], find something people would be interested in building.
