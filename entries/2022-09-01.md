Day 19  
Going to bed early last night worked. Woke up at 8:30. Writing thoughts. Keep reading The Road. Made breakfast. Mean streets of Chiraq. Terminator Jesus, he’ll be back. Entered our immunization record. Watched Jubilee. Apostrophus. See if we can get a job working in the library. My neighbour Totoro. Maverick, why is this man going so fast? Went back to Protobowl. The Fomorians. Young goodman brown. Tomato and eggs. Topgun. Maverick’s crazy. Anxiety picked up. Called Holden. Sliding in those DMs. Get our pushups back up there. Shower, read and go to bed. Keep finding ourselves still trying to log onto OLS.
