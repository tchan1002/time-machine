Grabbed two cupcakes on our way to Human Communication. Attention and WM. Talked with Vogel after class about mind-controlled cursors. Says he's starting up an experiment in a couple months. Baker with Claire. Bullish on Indonesia. Presented our [[Nowhere Collective]] Design brief to Katy. Next steps: build it out on figma. New sheets lowkey so comfy. 1517 medici. Sliced bread Ed’s meeting. Figure out what our legacy is to this club. Dropped by water polo. Fourth meal—built out homepage. Trolled for three hours.

Human communication. A group of deaf nicaraguan children may give us our best theory for language genesis. 

It's the same lesson as what MUN or Mock Trial taught us, the game is to be memorable. The larger the population, the greater that effect is. Understand the politics of selection. How a committee makes a decision comes down to who's on the committee.

Our advantage is that we've traveled 8000 miles around the country, and that we've been writing everyday for the last three to four years. 100d + 100dII = dataset. We have very good data about who we are. 

Writing velocity is the biggest limit to our productivity. If we put things on a homepage we have stuff to approach people with. That's the launchpad. Our life is ours.
