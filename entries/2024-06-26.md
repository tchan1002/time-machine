**Day 86**  
Did more coding during our shift. Grabbed dinner with Alice. Alice has a boyfriend, but at least he likes butter pecan. Napped. Put on our pants and went out to meet Faradawn. Church by Greenwood. Ran up and down Lake Shore. Went down the pier at Oakview Beach. What a view. Honey Hold Me, Rivers and Roads—our 2023 playlist was elite. Smooth 9 miler. Reminded of what’s at stake. Do things because we can. Watched the End of the Tour.

Run \+ Shower are biggest motivators  
Food is kind of a demotivator

We grew up thinking that each member of our family had worked so hard to live futile lives. That made us deeply unhappy. But now we find ourselves fanatical? So much has changed for us in the past year from taking up a camera and just saying yes to things. Make good on that\! 

Fardawn, Juliana, Nolan. Manar. Get more people on our runs.  
“Know thyself” is a poor translation. More so it is “know thy place”
