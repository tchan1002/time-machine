Day 65  
Review day. Find a library. Miasma. Went out for Dim Sum. Listened to Beige on repeat. A sad day turned good. Faces of Allston by Pete Cosmos. Quest Eternal by Donald DeLue. Ink Rats Neighbourhood Writing Group. Email inkratswriting@gmail.com. Sticker-picking in Boston. Acquired a copy of the Myth of Sisyphus. Thought a lot about UTL on our way back. Found an alternate start. Mugar Library sadly not open to the public. NJCL Convention packing list out. A sleepy New England town and its wacky host of characters. Logged down our ideas. Work on EVPN drafts now. Writing spaces in writing spaces. Register for NJCL activities. Sent email to Unger. Compose our English oratory. Evidence of beautiful souls. Found the song. Seventeen by Sjowgren. Nonce words. Μιμεισθαι. Held Moby’s flower for a minute and a half.

To do:  
Finish Placement Tests.  
EPVN drafts

Prompt: There is a hotel with a hundred rooms, and in every room there is a song. You walk into room 22, where the carpet, the covers, and the curtains are Beige.

UTL: Use the second person. “You change names, but you’re always in my head.” Employ an anonymous narrator to enhance focus. Use the protagonist as a vessel for the reader.  
“Entertainment is scarce, and I wouldn’t mind hearing what you’ve been up to.”

Song: Flowers in Your Hair by The Lumineers.
