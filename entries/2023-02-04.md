Woke up early in the morning. Sam fixed our hair at breakfast with some water. Potatoes with pepper. Fought hard Round 1\. Voir dired, round 2 got sloppy. Some tears for the end of our last round. Tired. Had dinner at Culvers with the rest of Samâ€™s car. Frozen lake. Talked to Isabella in the hallway. Green sweatshirt, khakis, rested against the carpeted floor. Sophia called. Finished and submitted our theater writeup. Might go by-busting tomorrow. Our student ID got picked up. Put in edits on our Moby Dick article. Went to bed.
