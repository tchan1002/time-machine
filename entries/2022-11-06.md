Woke up around 10\. Made breakfast in the house lounge. Got dressed and moved to the Reg. Power through. Greece and Rome essay dub. Mock scrimmage. Shape up for our tournament this weekend. Ate dinner at Woodlawn. Went to house council. Cinnamon Rolls. Talked to Sophia. Cleaned up our room. Slow down and breathe. Take things one at a time. Exeter's in the Never Have I Ever universe (“Exeter of the Rockies”)

Straight Up by James Sweeney. Shook. 4:3 aspect ratio. New favourite? Would be willing to watch it again. Soundtrack. Background noise set against silence. Running water at the sink. Leaves shuffling in the end scene.

*Baby if you love me, won’t you please just give me a smile.*
