**Day 6**  
Ran into Raghav at lunch. Told him about our summer. Humanities signature courses. Energy banking. Hung out at IHouse. Played ping pong. RA meet and greets. Finished Shogun. What a show. Drafted an email to our Breaditors.

What’s our review of Shogun? It really was quite gripping. Toranaga was effortlessly cool. And Yabushige was by far our favourite character. The incessant seppuku becomes almost ridiculous at times, but the show does emotional weight so well. Because we’re shown so well what these characters have to die for. Not some abstract idea of honour, but vengeance, salvation, these very concrete causes.
