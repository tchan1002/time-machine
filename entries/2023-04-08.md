Woke up. Had breakfast at Woodlawn with Noah. *Czech this, Czech that.* Walked to Cottage Grove with Devin and Sergio. Hopped on the green train. Read Confessions. The concrete celled buildings by Cermak McCormick. Ate at a Raising Cane's. Arrived at the Ogilvie transportation center. Underground market, kiddie train ride. Devin gave us a description of ghost in the graveyard. *Fox River Grove*. Got on a westbound train. Cityscape to flatland, barns, and silos. Devin’s brother Jonathan picked us up at Elburn. Basements and garages—changing definitions for a house on a hill. Devin drove us around DeKalb. The Egyptian Theater. Went for groceries at a HyVee. Milk and cream soda. Invest in a charcuterie board? A trip to Ollies, reminiscent of Uhlman’s and Stillwells. Devin bought us a black raspberry custard, with caramel and maraschino cherries as toppings. The afternoon sun, so close to the horizon. Had some sausages for dinner. Alternated between UFC and Hunger games. Peetah rizzed for the win. Took a shower and changed into some sleeping clothes. Slept. Izzy Adesanya, fortify your mind.
