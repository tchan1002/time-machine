Last day of visits. Entropia.ai. Bunch of guys from Itam. Got back to the hotel for Kigui, food waste cashback. Crashed. Took a little nap. Took an uber with Grace to Fundacion after missing the bus. Vines and dangling lights. End of trek. Took a nap and cleaned up before heading over to Belen’s. Fragmented clouds aglow. Met Belen’s family. Ulpe her brother, quite a smile. Tacos and Mariachi. Jose Miguel the cousin doing college in Michoacán? Practiced our Spanish. Red hot sauce candies. Found our way back to the hotel by two ubers. Stomach was bloating and we decided against going out. Slept.

In the deep dark pit/ with the drip drip drip/ the hour falls and slips and splits/ water gathers round the mouth/ as eagles fly on south.
