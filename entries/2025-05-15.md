#### Must Do's
- [x] Perspective piece

Last C&C lecture. Vogler called Serg and us her 'good omen people'. Shook her hand. Hot and humid out. Subcontinent swell. Lunch with Joe, talked whistletips and Indonesian bike mods. Honda cub. Slept after lunch. 6, went out and sat in the middle of the quad. Hydrangeas popped up like periscopes. Leaves like little blades. Typed up our homework. Ended up in some guy's b-roll. Caught up with Amber. Mango sunset over the Sundarbans. Dim flashes of light amidst the fog. Thunderstorms—verdict from resident meteorologist Angelito. Steak and Eggs: the Grand Finale. Cooked up $160 worth of meat. Flipped three eggs. Got in bed and dozed off.

We're already here. 来都来了。

Our lady of Guadalupe. Non est pictura.

Why Indonesia?
The archipelago. Biofauna. 
National parks could be huge.
