Woke up. First day of July. Packed up our stuff. Grabbed a quick coffee with Adarsh. Took a bluebird to Gambir. En route, some military parade at Monas? Food stalls covered the entrance. Banyak orang. Paratroopers (?), and people grappling down from the roof of the monument. Had a soto ayam for breakfast, and bought two rice rolls before hopping on the Manahan. Read Mishima, read half of it. Shaved, showered, cleaned up at the Omah Garuda. Called Aboo, Mom. Book hotel for tmr and flight. Pack in the morning. Lowkey so tired for no reason. Listened to Illnoise. Went out for dinner. Picked up these Banoffee Wafers which were pretty good. Finished squid game. Started not feeling so good, stomach-wise.

Mental health can't be the death of us.
Really started missing the new england fall on the train. Hopefully this is not the last of those days. We do like that crisp air. Maybe someday we'll move back to New Hampshire.

The early anthropologists warned against going native. They saw too much of an inner wilderness in skins black and brown. We set out in the world today and find an encroaching modernity. Which is, still, a time and space of its own.
