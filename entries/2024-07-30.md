**Day 52**  
Packed. Made cola chicken again—cleaned out the fridge. Simple living can have depths of experience. Train to New York. Quick bite at K-town. Stopped by FIT. The runners at Hudson Yard. Afternoon sun. Javitz center. *A lamp maker?* Two strangers. A million green aphids scrambled up our legs. *Pozole.* Read Deyan Sudjic’s *The Language of Things,* then a bit of Kerouac’s *On the Road.* Descriptions of the midwest awoke something in us... Des Moines, Davenport, go west\! Arrived in Philly, by which time our suitcase had completely fallen apart. Lugged it on our back to Chloe’s. Stopped by a CVS for a slim jim’s and strawberry vanilla olipop. Virgins in heaven. 

When we get back to Chicago: continue our progress on our permit. Get a skateboard. Get a typewriter. Figure out some place to live? WHPK, Klubnacht—get involved\! Only 2 more years left. 

A million pictures from all over/ the world has lost their fight to colour.    
Quinn told us they’re picky when it comes to critters—only butterflies and some of the prettier moths.

Slaughter beach dog and a certain resurrection of the soul—that night coming back from the concert with Josie, shouting out the lyrics to Phoenix. 104 degrees. Past year has changed us in such beautiful ways.
