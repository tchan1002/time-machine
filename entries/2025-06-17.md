#### Must Do's

Breakfast. Got a massage at Nano with mom. Shot of thick ginger tea. Wedang Jahe. Went down close to Monas. Some military celebration. Quick walk through the national museum. Grand Indonesia mall was kind of nice. Ate at a restaurant called Remboelan. Soupy rice. Started raining a bit around sunset. Got back home. Dinner at Grandma Pho again. Kind of bombed our mock interview. Last full day in Jakarta. Mom and Chloe flying back home tomorrow.
