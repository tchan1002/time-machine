#### Must Do's

- [x] The slow death.

Fitting session out at the tailor's. Oxfords, not brogues. Indo plans. Fix unbelievable brain fog. Frank Lloyd Wright's last stand—the Illinois. Dinner out with Aboo, Mom, Chloe. 中山公园，龙之梦。Finally published the slow death. Listen to James Evans Big Brain podcast. Maybe we ought to write to James Evans. Capture as many of our thoughts into article form as we can. Chatted with Johanna. Emily Shi gave us some advice. Don't be so focused on the what, that we lose sight of the how—we only need to communicate who we are, not what we believe in.

We're going to get [[Schwarz]]man because we want it more badly than anyone else does.
