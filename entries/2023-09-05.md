Day 3  
Woke up at 6:00 in the morning. Right before sunrise. Heated up some soup downstairs. The one piece live action. Raspberries for breakfast. Just two days till we’re in Chicago. Crashing with Elijah. Took the bus with mom to Cornell Scott Hill. Got our fillings. Mouth numb. Did pushups. Become a Jeremy Fragrance. Took the bus down to New Haven. Waited for Clark outside Phelps gate. Ran into Chris Shia. Played pool with Clark. Sunset. Grabbed ice cream with Daniel. Walked around and talked. Took the bus and then ran home in the dark. The A team. 

Friendships of convenience vs friendships of intention. The two are perhaps not so distinct categories. We herd towards convenience. We intentionally create systems of convenience to keep friends around. 

1.4 billion people  
spending their whole lives to push their kid forward

In Shanghai, the day before we left, Dad told us he hoped he didn’t sour our views on marriage. Think that was something incredibly hard for us to get over, thinking that we’ve been set up to fail in that regard (re: our convo with Oia last winter). Always think that we’re weird or make things weird, or really that we’re ugly. But we’re reminded that people generally like to spend time with us… and that, heck, some people even find us cute. And that’s good enough for us.
