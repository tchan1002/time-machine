Got our poli-sci paper back. Doing good, on track to finish, just have to grind these couple weeks. Get our apes report down today. Camera in a camera factory. Updated our linkedin. Listened to CHVRCHES. Saturday plans. God, we're productive. Best Intentions by Hodera sponsored a moment. Grabbed some food at Woodlawn. Turned left instead of right and ended up at the Logan center. Place is huge\! Ran into Ashley, Adan, then Sumin. Get grapes. Got ourselves some black grapes from Jewel-osco. Attended our RA zoom meeting, sent in our stuff. The Jedi code. Prepared grapes. Wrote a message for Coach Sam. Got our pushups in, showered. Good stuff. Bucketlist item: go see Sumo wrestling. Secret-life-of-Walter-Mitty this thing. Get running shorts, a wifebeater, and white socks.  
   
Snippet: When the meteor arrived with its shaggy haired flagellants, the Romans could not recognize their great mother. 

Quantumania:  Envision ourselves an alien scientist, adventurer, intergalactic explorer. 

Song: Best Intentions by Hodera.
