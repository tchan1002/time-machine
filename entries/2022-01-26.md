The devil at the crossroads. Clay and friends. Quebecois. Go to the dollar store and pick up a couple notebooks. Remember to use grill bucks. Bought a grape soda. Didn’t feel great today, but let’s climb back up. Shower, get good sleep, and drink water. Show gratitude to friends and hide anger. Ego and desire. Ezra Pound Li Bai. Anthology. The Oriental Institute at Chicago. Cool museums to look forward to. Might enjoy Keats. Romanticism, Imagism and Vorticism. Build off those who have come before. Ha Jin. Emma Mackey’s in Death on the Nile. Witty Neoteric Poetry. Brilliant writing on Shameless. A budding psychosis. 

“To see the world in a grain of sand”

Meta: refrain from the *damnatio memoriae* of past selves. 

The moon outside my window,  
Glistens like the frost,  
I rise to watch the moon  
Falling deep in thought.
