And perhaps we change the world. Brunch with Guangxinyang that could change everything? We’re not really strangers, syzygy—we jump on this opportunity. Talked to over a hundred strangers today. Delicia and Lobo. Fucked ourselves over with Dante, but maybe necessary. Hosanna down at the A level. Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are dead. Shadow puppets. Scheduled a meeting with Paul.
