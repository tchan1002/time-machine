#### Must Do's
- [x] Pushup-failure

Morning. Wrote out essays during character and commerce. Reintegrate with our notes. We've got it. Pushup-failure. Showered, cut our hair, shaved. Blessed chicken salad from the Kosher station. Back into it. Eras of invincibility. How did [[Papam]] wipe out 2 weeks from our quarter. End of week 5. Agenbite of inwit. Less than 4 weeks left of the quarter. Use it well. 30 days a month. Rebuild our shoulders.

*Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now.*
But memory goes through and so we are the same. 
I, I and I. I. A.E.I.O.U
