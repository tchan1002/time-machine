Day 79  
Got paid on Venmo. Edit LORs. PL36. Send test scores over to Chicago. Do placement tests. Speed through LORs. Maximize pay for work. Built our armature out of bread ties and foil. Cooked a spaghetti 葱油面 hybrid for dinner. Asked for movie recs—expand our horizons. Au hasard Balthazar. Lacustrine. Read some Wilde. Hercules. Smyrna. Gautier. Went easy on our run. Those blisters we used to have at the start of every season. Super flower blood moons. Fleabag. Submit LoRs tomorrow. 

Song: Winona Ryder by Picture This.
