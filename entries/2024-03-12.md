Morning, packed and checked out of our airbnb. Took the metrobus to Le Meridien. Set out for breakfast. The air became hostile, our eyes kept tearing up. Showed mom El Cardena. Walked around the historic center, by the Palacio Nacional and the ruins of the old temple. The sun was blinding. Made it to the post office before our eyes closed up. Recuperated with mom in a coffee shop opposite Bella Artes. Sipped on some horchata. Passed through Chinatown on our way back to the hotel. Grabbed a last meal of various tacos close to Chinatown. Met Trek people at La Sirloneria. Sent mom off to her uber. Recouped. Went to bed.
