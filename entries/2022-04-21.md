April, a primate? Did our reading at breakfast. Do laundry today. Grind out our Analysis. Praeteritio. Assignment next Wednesday. A bus ticket. Checked out the DSL. Party Game Alliance. A game of spoons. Ethics in America. Asian Carnival coming up in 3 weeks. Soul fest in 2? Slept for a bit in assembly. Euphrosine, memento mori. A Turkish mosaic. Fell to a dehydration spell. Rejuvenation of the soul, a baptism of water. Made some of the ramen and eggs. Did our laundry. The defense of Sam Moore. Went out for a cool two mile. Look through proctor apps. Two days till certamen.

Still, One task for tonight:
Shower Done
Grab water and wash dishes Done
Write our analysis piece Done

To be betrayed by the singular crown of a strawberry
we were eating in Langford’s room.

Discussion Question
“The body, on the other hand, is homogeneous as anything. Indivisible, a one-piece suit, a sacred temple if you will.” (270) How do you see the symbolism of the body, the finger or of blood as it relates to this chapter and before? Parallels to India, of Bombay the pointing finger, or of the Raleigh painting?

Plan for On Positivism:
Work until 12.
Input all our quotes Done
Outline of argument Done
Spinning of narrative (Do when we wake up tomorrow)
Formatting (Before midnight)

Spend tomorrow writing.
