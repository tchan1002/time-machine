Slept in. Soccer match today. Went downstairs to Tiffins. Chinese New Year\! Drafted our essay. Sat with Zofie’s friends from St. Louis and Sophia. Showed Clancy the scum manifesto. Went off to soccer. Professional heckling. *Surround, encircle, devour*. Another sweet sweet dub. Came back and showered. Got the extension on our essay for Wednesday. Love Tiffins and ihouse. What is best in life? Did our theater homework. Compartmentalize, we’re gonna finish this week alive. 

*You were sleeping beside me. I pulled you in and asked if you could hear my heartbeat, the question in my head had yet to be uttered.*

Coolcat: Going through one weird moment. Earpods dangling across the midway. Mr. Brightside. The inner scream. We are distinctly, unequivocally alive. Past couple of weeks have been great. Thanks for the green hills, for Navy Pier, for PT Anderson, for Moby Dick, for Avatar 2\. Thank you for the A level alcoves. Thanks for Thompson soccer, for the sweet sweet taste of victory, and thanks for women.

Song: Issawa Style by H-Kane.
