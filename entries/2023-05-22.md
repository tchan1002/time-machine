Woke up, showered, compartmentalize. Finish our apes report today. Review for exos. Polisci will be tomorrow and Wednesday's mission. Had lunch with Ryan. Elijah gave us a really nice headshot for our linkedin page. Sort out our books tonight. 董小姐. Marks of our youth. Come so far, let’s keep working. Wrote about Hong Kong for our coolcat, document parts of the city, Rushdie’s Imaginary Homelands. Pay a visit to the Kowloon Walled City. Did 40 pushups in a row, return to R2A. Koko the Gorilla, speech defends our humanity. Sensu lato. 

Music:  
The Ballad of Cleopatra—Lumineers  
Illinois—Sufjan Stevens  
安和桥北—宋冬野
