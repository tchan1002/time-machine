Day 56  
A New Yorker’s guide to Chicago. View of the World from 9th Avenue. Met Kary at the mtr station. Macaroni at Maccies. Read up on Transwarp. Went out to lunch with Kary’s dad. Curry tonkatsu at Ro Ann. A view across the harbor from TST. *Talking ‘bout whales*. Took the train back to Central. *Rawdogging this, rawdogging that*. Put on our green tie, went out to the UChicago intern reception. Ran into our neighbour. Our hunger, too perceptible. Have to hide it. Had dinner at a vegetarian place in Sogo, met Ronke. Went back. Did pushups. 

Look into air filtration systems.   
Imagine owning all the oxygen in the world.
