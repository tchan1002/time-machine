Woke up early in the morning. Bus tour of Chicago. Sunny out. St Michael’s church. Went down to Pullman. Guang won 3000 dollars for amigo. Maybe we’re really going somewhere. Summer breeze. Aurora we did not see. Went down to the point. Stopped by Open Produce on the way back. Sat on the curb eating banana chips.
