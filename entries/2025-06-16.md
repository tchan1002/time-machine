#### Must Do's

16 hour sleep? Woke up feeling more refreshed. Breakfast—we could get used to this place. Reddit's banned here. Called Max Kastl in the morning—who's thinking about a career change 2 weeks at Centerview Houston. Gojek to kaum jakarta for lunch, nice restaurant and good vibes. They really like ox-tongue. Middle class menus here don't include the last three digits. Called Wallace about Schwarzman. Groceries at the grandlucky. Called Xavier about Schwarzman. Traffic jam home. Good pho eats for dinner. Debriefed dad.

The unfortunate realization that if pollution poisons the water, it poisons life itself. It's omnipresent. Jakarta's uppermiddle class must only move between airconditioned rooms. Where do they get their exercise? Massive indoor complexes? Tennis?
