Woke up and called Dad. Updated him about all the great stuff we’ve been on. Went to religion. Got a long text back from Skylar. Had a great time talking to Taka-san from NHK though. Interviewed with Darius from Leagueswype. Called Kary. Got so upset that we ended up calling Chloe. Made pity pasta. *Take a break and just focus on doing our stuff—build the garden.*
