Day 69  
Woke up. Took the mtr to Shau Kei Wan, then the 9 bus to Shek O. Met up with Abigail, then met Jalen from UWC. Lounged about in the water, the sand soft. Had skewers for lunch before Abigail showed us the rocks. Dawn in the Adan. Clear water in crevices. Crabs and sea urchins. People with their gloves and tongs wading through the water, collecting various mollusks. Got really close to a butterfly. Its veins leaflike. Arrived in Kennedy town at 4\. Walked to the UChicago campus, round the mountain green. The islands in the distance. Black sesame soy milk. Returned to the mtr station with our phone dead. Ran into Phoebe from our TAPs class, we were shook. Sunburnt. Olger came, then 崔姐. Ate. Balled with the HKU masters students in the courts by the sea. 奥黑卡卡吃先生. Went to Shark’s place to play cards. Took a cab back home. 

Snippet: On a rabid hunt for the black moth. An urge to capture living things. To take pictures of people’s shiba inus. To find a corner untouched. To section off a piece of land and say *I’m the king of this hill.*

An affinity for those who get off at the same stop. Your neighbors. Our work has exposed us to every strata of society. Filipino, South Asian diaspora, refugees, expats. The cocktail bun is a metaphor. Who does Hong Kong belong to?

Song: Dawn in the Adan by Ichiko Aoba.
