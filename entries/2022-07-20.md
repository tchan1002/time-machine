Song: I Ran by A Flock of Seagulls.

Prompt: A man works on a laptop in his run-down apartment, using a radiator as his table. His chair is faulty, and there’s nothing else beside him but a mattress. The man writes in his journal and talks to his friends on the computer. He looks occasionally out the window. Day turns to night, and the man catches a drunkard shouting slurs on the street. The drunkard passes and it is quiet again. The man goes for the door, but as he twists the handle he pauses. He only exists within the room, where the walls are green and white.
