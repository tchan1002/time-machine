Woke up at 6:00. Showered. Interview. Paced about. Sang Backstreet Boy's Chances to calm us down. Litany of fear. Heart on our sleeve. We'll see what comes out. 爱笑的男生运气不会太差. Lowkey bad sleep this past week. Adarsh texted that we can crash at his tmr in Jakarta. Wali Sanga pilgrimmage is a go. Said bye to friends. Dad picked us up. Quarter of summer done. Zohran met his wife on hinge. Figure out indo finances. Used chat to parse three years worth of daiily journal entries into markdown files. 4 years of our life, a full megabyte. Early wake tmr, go to bed.

Schwarzman is only the wakeup call that we need to do something with our life.
Today is when we start planning.
Get that obsidian plugin figured out.
Next we upload who's on stuff
Wali Sanga project (full documentary)

[[Webapp Ideas]]: AI for personal finance. "You sure you want to spend money on that?"

Month recap: indo experience was huge. Glad to have spent time with family before in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Cool to have revisted our kindergarden. Schwarzman was an exciting opp, if it goes through we have one more year of time (and a great platform). We do want to dress better and look better. We could also do more on a project ront. Write our novels, upload the stuff we've been meaning to for quite a while. 

What don't we like about our life
No follow through on big projects
No bitches
Dress well.
