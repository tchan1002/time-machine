Finished our piece on Johanna dâ€™Arc of Mongolia in bed. Woke up and walked to Hutch. Picked up some saffron that we then Ate with Ryan outside. Talked to Sergio about Mongolia. Spent a couple hours with Elijah and Asa around a table. Ran into the pop people on the quad, went to Berry Palooza at Woodlawn. Walked back up north to play Wopo. Beautiful day. Game with the alums. Went to fourth meal with Louis, ran into Lulu. Talked to Clancy. Walked home with Sumin. McGregor Forever. 

Experiencing sex and love we pondered loneliness, and found the division of our bodies to be a sin. To be absolved of it we found god.

Start saying old sport. One needs a catchphrase: *good stuff buddy.*
