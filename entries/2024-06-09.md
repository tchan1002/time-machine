**Day 103**  
Three days off starting now. How are we making this hype video? Went by Jewel-Osco. Soursop nectar, interesting. Luke came over for lunch. Made steak. Convo until 3\. Talked memory, politics, and gorillas. Walked over to the point for a swim with Ann. Scientists Successfully Teach Gorilla It Will Die (The Onion)

Notes on a conversation with Luke: Talked about how fickle our collective memory is. The “state of nature” is a retroactive reconstruction. The study of anthropology has always been plagued by contemporary narratives of who we are (via Apes and Human Evolution). Value of a statistical life. WTP (Willingness 2 Pay) for an additional one percent chance of dying. 

Here is what I’m thinking: This is our base of operations. 104 days till the end of summer. Of course we count. We are the hand of the arm that reaches towards the sky, the tip of the conscious universe.

Amigo: what we’re really tackling is drinking culture. People are tired and want more meaningful and fulfilling social interactions. They don’t want to get wasted anymore. 

Stranger \#3: Met Jesus and his brother Juan “Tookie” at the point, who tried to hit on Ann. Got Jesus to take a dip in the water with us. Fabuloso. Jesus was from Sinaloa. For unclear reasons, his brother Juan Tookie initially told us he was Jesus’ cousin.
