#### Must Do's
- [x] Read Psych slides
- [x] Do psych textbook questions

Woke up this morning so rushed. Caught in a panic. No paper in the Yuen printer, we went to class distraught. Gabe took our paper anyways. Took after class to realize we’re fine. Lunch at Bart. 12 to 2 shift at Reynolds. We wanted to fall asleep. [[Moran]] came by to say hi. A little ice cream to brighten up our day. Napped. The Lives of Others, then app dev. Asked ourselves if Mark Zuckerberg jerks off. Got up and went to water polo. Knock out quizzes before we go to bed.

Realized in class we had not even opened our appdev homework from last week. 5 point penalty, but maybe we just needed the reminder. Get back up one of these days—rebuild a good relationship with Raghu. No need to be awkward about it.
