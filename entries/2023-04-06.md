Woke up. Got dressed. Mallard in the lab school pond. Big bird by Rockefeller. Had noodles at Hutch with Fredric, Min and Abhir. Moved to the A level. Sat down with Devin. 逃跑计划. Grabbed a quick bite at Baker with Alex Fan. Sebastian got us a Mango Lassi from the A level vending machine. The astro crowd. Astro Boys. Picked up our prospies at Woodlawn—Mercer and Ammar. Took them to the club fair at Reynolds. Ran into Mason McCormack. Played Markovitz at Campus South. 4-5, war cry. Went to the Thompson study break. Learned to play exploding kittens. Devoured a salad. Took Mercer and Ammar out to Survivor. Full moon on the quad. Became a villain of the night. Returned and figured out sleeping logistics.
