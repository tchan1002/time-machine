Met with Harvey at Valois. Had two eggs sunny-side up. Took the bus up to Andersonville. Mused on Exeter. Sweet Caroline. Flipped through old magazines at the Brown Elephant. Jellyfish Hat. Walked by Wrigley Field. Took the red line back. Napped till 8\. Dreamt about improv. Sophia came to visit. Did our laundry. Got food at Tiffins. Start running when our cough goes away. Sore muscles. You season 4\. John Wick? Watched a bunch of trailers. Wanting to spruce up our room.

Ask Lulu about the wood hanger and prints.

Snippet: Sweet Caroline, Fall EA. The stone stands of the stadium, the sun setting on the trees. 

Doctrine: Mused on Exeter. Perhaps itâ€™s not such a bad thing to lose our awe when we trade it for maturity. You grow up and exchange roles with the people you look up to.
