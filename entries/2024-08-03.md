**Day 48**  
Shamefully slept in. Packed and showered. Bit the bullet—got our Amtrak multi rail pass. Ordered train tickets. Went to Luke’s. Filmed part II of date. Met Don from Racer Clarence. Put the sweat in *sweatshirt*. Moochapalooza tomorrow with Alex F. Settled on Luke’s couch.

*Wa-wa* for water.
