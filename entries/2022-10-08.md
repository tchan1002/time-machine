Woke up and watched the Notebook. Cried thinking of Jacqueline. Got dressed and joined Thompson downstairs. Rode a bus to Indiana. Gummy Pizzas. Apple picked in an orchard. Sat on a hay bale. Honey crisp weather. Received our Mock acceptance in a straw cornucopia. Slept on the bus ride back. Alex joined us in an unsuccessful search for our keycard. Still a fine fine day. Zombified en route to the Reg. Responded to Mock and Commedia. Travelled to Noodles Etc for some curry noodles. Returned to ihouse and napped. Sam has our keycard. Moved down to the Tiffinâ€™s cafeteria to close read the Republic. Tried the seafood variant of the tofu stew. Had a tremendous apple cake. Finish our close reading in the morning.
