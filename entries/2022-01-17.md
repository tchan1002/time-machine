Kira’s birthday. Luca Changretta sounds exactly like Dimitri. Markov Chains. Bathsheba. Ecological succession. Malthus. Regain Latin Proficiency. Warm outside today. Got lunch with Taraz. Urim and Thummim. Esau selling his birthright. Chinese Educational Mission at Exeter. Might be something really interesting to investigate. They really killed MLK. The 13th amendment. Blue Monday. Weightless Marconi Union. Interviewing soon. Dude was kinda strange. Talked to Sabrina. Terry Silver is actually an awesome coach. Remember why we’re doing this. Another day of homework done before tomorrow. Insane that we go to Exeter. The teacher of teachers. 

“If you can’t do great things, do small things greatly.” MLK.

“You ever ask a man how he’s doing and he says “I’m all right.“ I'm here to tell you that man is not all right. That man is battling demons that you cannot even possibly imagine. That man is struggling every single day to find a reason to keep going. And the reason we say we’re alright is because, as a man, no body fucking cares what you’re going through. So why even bother to say it, but you know what. I feel you brother, because I’m alright too.”
