[[Keep in Mind]]
#### Must Do's

Morning. Met Jacinta at Reynolds. Scoped out Union Station. We'll bring tripods. Back, Nelson with the Lyftâ€”seeking help with his English. Lunch. Ian from 7/11 got fired. Slept till 3. Made goch gnocchis. Clipped nails. 

MacDonald's Speedee System.
Take the train down tmr.
You ever been out west and seen the expanse?

Belew staying with us in march.

"How do we make stuff happen? What stuff do we want to make happen?
We certainly don't create possibilities by staying in. 
We create opportunities by reaching out.
Relentless outreach. Letting people know what's up. 
Look less at what other people are doing. 
Visualize, visualize, visualize.

We want to travel, we want to be on the road. 
We want to travel with someone. 
We want to be shameless. 
We want to do stunts that make people go "woah that's cool"
That's the effect that we want to deliver."


Idea for eliminating the fugue state:
figure out what our triggers are.
