Day 5  
Woke up at 5:00. Got the D-Nik roster in the morning. A weird sort of feeling to see our next year realized. Left for the airport. Said goodbye to Dad. Sent Joe and Cristi an introductory blurb of ourselves. Took off. Put our headphones in and started bawling on the plane. Mount Fuji above the clouds. Got to Haneda. Left for the city. Took the train to Meguro. Put our stuff in a JR station locker. Walked around a park. Had cream puffs from a Fami-Mart. Tired. Made our way to Heiwajima. The sunset\! We stopped just to look at the sky. Rouge waves. Onsen was the move. Through geological time. Had Udon for dinner. Napped in a bean bag room. Public baths are awesome. Grind out our Singapore trek reflection today and tomorrow.

Meta: Entries have been short the past week, maybe because we’ve been traveling. Or maybe we’ve shifted from writing to visual curation. In any case, we’re still dealing with memory.
