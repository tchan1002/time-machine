Stayed in. Have to find a solution to our allergies. Felt awful, a really lazy day. Hay fever? Made a Walgreens and Trader Joes trip. Blueberry goat cheese log on Tuscan pane. Yum. Watched more episodes of Solar Opposites. Molly the mouse, cow-steed, desert camel, nourishing vehicle. Brushed our teeth. 

The poverty of human imagination.  
Beekeeping. 

Dreamt that we were two kids in the dark in front of an open fridge. Scallions in a jar of garlic oil, saran-wrapped. Woke up and thought Chloeâ€™s arms were around us, turned around to find nothing.
