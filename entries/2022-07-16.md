Went out to eat with some Choate parents. Walked a decent bit through MIT. Took the bus back. Legs feeling a little sore. Ubuntu. The sea beast, old man and the sea? The Kikayon. Jonah and the Whale. Had a nice chat with Indigo. The Classic Updog. Had Chinese leftovers for dinner. The Chicago Boys. Sent out a poll. Meet up with people in Boston. Phaistos Disk. Had an idea about a Cambrian Explosion board game.
