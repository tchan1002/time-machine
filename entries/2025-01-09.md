#### Must Do's
- [x] Germany reflection

Morning classes. A "whale" is a small word for a large animal, and a "microorganism" is the reverse — Hockett. Anterograde amnesia. Stopped by Ida for the winter club fair. Sat with Josie and Alexa. Acquired a yeti. Flicked up mayor Brandon Johnson. From a student "why are you so unpopular." Maroon Section Head's. Back at SB. 21 person turnout—damn. Dinner with Nathan, first year photographer, reminded of what responsibilities we have. Escape Mr. Stevens era and get back to Jeremy Allen White (though we really oscillate).

Get up young man get up.

Distinguish cryptography from semiotics. To what extent do emoji's merely encode? EMOJI communication protocol.
