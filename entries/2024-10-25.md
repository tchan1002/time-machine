#### Must Do's
- [x] WHPK confirmation

Showered. Breakfast. Went to Psych Research Methods. Humilk in front of the reg. Met Niko Stangs, an animals rights activist. Grabbed his contact, follow up for a long form piece about Vegan campus activism. Lunch. Wrote an email about survey design to Sameera. Met Zac at mind and biology. 10 ladybugs. Struggled with the microscope. Building ephys drives might sadly not be our thing, we're looking for a different type of interview. One door closes, another door opens. We're now a WHPK DJ. Ran into [[Nic Restivo]] at the reg. Talked science communicationâ€”that could be our show. Mina Lee. Nearly got stuck on the fourth floor of Searle. Dropped by founder meetup. Went to Moda's cast call. Sent in our WHPK confirmation. 4 hours at Suffrage Sounds. 

There is no past or future, only the basement
in this moment we are enjoined by a paradox of pain

Everyone can speak at length given the right question.
