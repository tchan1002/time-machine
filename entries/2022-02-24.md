Hailee Steinfield in Emily Dickinson TV show. The linguistic link between “preface” and “prima facie”. Had a nice time sitting in Grill with Harry and Oscair. Ukraine’s getting invaded. The future is insured. Resting sad face. Two tapestries will suffice. Ahead of the curve. The conference of birds. Who mourns for Adonis? Ukraine is really bad. World War III?

“Ukraine or Russia?”  
“Same here, same here.” 

Doctrine: Think writers are the loneliest, because you read their work with your voice and not theirs. The distance between art and artist. When does it become too hard to trace fallen leaves to their branches?
