Had breakfast at Woodlawn with Zofie. Moved to Harper. Abstain from music. Ran into Ginny at Harper. Had lunch at Cathay with Ryan. Mid-life crises. Sat down in a Stuart cubicle with Ryan and Judy. The secret life of Walter Mitty. Apes class sad. Walked back home and napped. Have some self discipline. Write\! Nacreous polar stratospheric clouds\! Had dinner at Woodlawn. Ate with Alec. Iced tea with lemons, little delights. Showed up to wopo. Donned headgear for a scrimmage. Lyfted back with Louis. Listened to Clancy play guitar. Joseph and his hot wheels collection. A map of New York.

Spot the white winged moth,  
The silver-tipped cocoon.   
All are born tonight under the moon.

The human resource has become expendable. Ryan said, this is a silly life.   
These dying impulses of an electric brain. How we suffer these little deaths. 

Judy Song Recs:  
Maggie Rogers. Falling water. Love you for a long time.  
Leon Bridges. River. Beyond. 

*Do not call Gibbons great apes.*
