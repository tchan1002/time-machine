Day 20. A little more than three weeks left. Returned Robert Indiana's Four Winds. "Take good care of selfâ€”long journey ahead." Chilly outdoors until the sun came in. Benadryl, psychopomp, ferry us nether. Baker, had ice cream. Sat with Warrick for a second. Read. Midday nap. Sunburned cheeks. Fire drill. India and Pakistan wage war. North staff meeting. Strange sense of finality. Slept. Mom texted. Neared the end of Calvino's invisible cities. 5 miles into the storm. Rainbow Kitten Surprise. 2 sets of pushups. Grabbed our camera and headed over to scav. 

Leave the land of images.
Unam ecclesiam.

Ok to be an oddity and a little solitary. We only have to prove to ourselves how happy we are. Let's waste zero time and speed towards it. Don't be left behind. No regrets.
