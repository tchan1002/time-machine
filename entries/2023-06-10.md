Day 90  
Batman, we’ve returned with a vengeance. Went out for Dim Sum. Settled down in the To Kwa Wan library. No room of one’s own, but headphones are nice for artificial barriers. Back to Mrs. Davis—great show. Meeting Russell tonight. Get a headstart on recruiting prep for this summer. A craving for cucumber sandwiches. Took the bus to Causeway bay. Sat on top of the doubledecker. Shabu Shabu feasted with Russell.

Nooks and crannies and alleyways, this city is suffocating.
