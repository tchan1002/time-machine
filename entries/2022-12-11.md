Day 22  
Warmth lured us to sleep. Awake now. Draft an email to Terhune. Reached out to Powley. Meeting him tomorrow at 9 AM. Worked on our transfer app. Updated our resume. Miss advocating for kids on CCC. Think we’ll call up the CCO office tomorrow. To be in *imago dei*. Zoomed for Mock Trial. *Weece was wrong.* Went for a two miler in the snow. Drafted our coolcat to Fleet Foxes’ *Montezuma*. Talked to Will Park, shared with him our reflection on trains. Daniel called.
