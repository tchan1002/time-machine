#### Day 30
- [x] Capital Memo 1
- [ ] [[No Leftovers]]

*30 day countdown. How are we going to make today full? Start by finishing up our assignments so that we can go outside. Get dressed, eat at baker, and grind out at harper or sth.* 

Slept in until noon. Dreamt that we were traveling within different people's rooms. Listened through our Cesare Borgias playlist. Stayed in and grinded until 4 on an explanation of the working day. Go eat. Go outside. Have nice things. Three plates of butter chicken at bart. Sat with Kaan and Tony. Skated all the way over the point. Verdant fields, afternoon sun, seafoam. Magnolias, fat white and purple cloves. People running, biking. Chloe called us. Dinner. Citrus to fix our scurvy, heal our mouth, stop the bleeding. Getting cold out. Dozed off right as we got back. At least we didn't spend the day on autopilot.

EOD, how can we do tomorrow better? Wake up early. get through more of ulysses. Less time in transit? Write something onto our substack. Allergy meds. Switch out our toothpaste. Text Alexa. Just dance. Reflection makes life full.
