Grabbed breakfast with Moran. Thought we misplaced our hippo. Went on a goose chase around campus. Settled in Hutch to read Leviticus. Messed around on squarespace. Sliced bread is 15 years old? Saw pictures of the team in old issues of the mag. We’re enacting a resurrection. Dug through Mary Douglas’ Purity and Danger. Grabbed Saffron. Found our hippo at Swift. Religion. Caught up with Josh. Talking about nanotubes. Go see the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, recommendation via Daniel. RAs talking about unionizing. Dropped by debate. Walked back North for the fire drill. Aired out our sneakers.

Mary Douglas: Reflection on dirt. Religion is a question of classification (c.f Durkheim). The Taxi Driver must define himself against the filth, separate himself from the muck.

Snippet: Saw their faces, and it was as if, all of a sudden, I heard a thousand screams come out from below the hill, like a colony of bats bursting from a mound.
