Easter sunday. Woke up and brushed our teeth. The Northeast megalopolis. America’s megaregions. Watched more of *Freaks and Geeks*. *Butterdog*. Played Codenames with Devin’s grandma. Smart ass, trivia. Feasted on rolls, glazed ham, and mashed potatoes. Introduced Devin and Sergio to 忌廉沟鲜奶. Golden afternoon in suburbia. Park bench, lilypad pond. Devin’s dad drove us home. Cried on the way back, like we did in Roy Baek’s car. Mistook a burger king sign for a rising moon. *Jeg elsker deg.* Left a cutie for Gabby when we got back. Had dinner at Tiffins with Sophia. Adan cleaned up the back of our hair. *Agnus dei.* Early sleep, rise up tomorrow. 

Snippet: Fox river grove and the ice cream truck we worked summers and scoops and scoops till elbows deep and a smidge of rocky road on your nose as you laugh and go for the maraschino cherries. 

Snippet: Passed a burger king moon on the interstate. Saw again the monstrous body of time in a faltering neon sign.
