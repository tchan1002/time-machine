Packed. Went to Valois to eat with Yuto. Michael Moran\! Got ourselves two eggs, hash browns, and coleslaw. Fries were good. Wet T-Shirt contests. Carpooled with Minseo to O’Hare. Ran into Rina and Belen, who were on the same flight as us. Passed the time with Siddartha, a very appropriate read to round off Q5. *A deviation from the ascetic life can be one of learning nonetheless.* Infinite jest. Got stuck in customs. Took an uber to our airbnb. Building mixup, pulled out the *necesito wifi.* Thank god for everyone who taught us Spanish. Sleep and rest up. Go get some food tomorrow. 

Taqueria Orinoco. 

Actors, writers, and all manners of artists clamber to stowaway in other’s minds. A fear response to oblivion—they cannot forego the self. There’s something masturbatory about it—the universe exists only to be perceived. And we are a vox clamantis in deserto.
