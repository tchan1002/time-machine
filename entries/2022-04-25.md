Climate action day. Hocus Pocus. Do laundry. Freshen up. Channus. Coals to Newcastle. Went to assembly. The Burning of Paradise. Climate action literature. Laser guns and pumped up kicks. Hung out for a while at Grill. Meeting at 4.00. Catch up on reading. As it was. Get groceries. Met for CSO Turnovers. Dinner and a movie. Herodotus. Fries are definitely the number one grill food. Paused on the bite of 83. Went to Grill. Read more of Hocus Pocus. Tony Chang. Good time talking with Jacqueline on the agora couches. Area code betrayed you Rishi. Made a cool cat post. Remember that writing is memory. Cognate accusatives. A viewing of Cool Cat Saves the Kids.

Makes me incredibly happy when I talk to you, but incredibly sad afterwards?
