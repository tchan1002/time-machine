Day 47  
Got out of bed. Had some dimsum with Aboo and 公公. Took the mtr to 太子 to pick up some things from 二姑媽. Had a pineapple bun with her and 伯伯. Took the mtr to HKU for a rendezvous. Called Ryan. *What a terrible summer to contract class consciousness.* Ran into Lucy and Nandi by the station lifts. Took the bus to Stanley. HK rizz. Met Andrew and Thomas. Had some pan seared barramundi at a Spanish restaurant. Walked by the pier, then around the market. Through the lens of another camera, a framing device. Lucas sent us some pictures of Peruvian baroque architecture. Neon street signs, RA room decor? Entered Ma Hang park. Went down by the beach. White coral. Picked up two halves of a clamshell, tint of magenta on its edges. Returned her to the sea. Took the bus with Lucy back to central, then the mtr back home. A calmness as we exited the station. Rouge clouds in the evening sky. Girls Just Want To Have Fun. Did pushups. Showered. Slept.

Live in the quiet moments now. Summers always have us so battered. Still, some little fire in us.

那晚, 一夜通宵之後吃鮑魚粥.  
幾個鮑魚從罐頭里放在了粥里  
还加了几个微波炉好的水煮蛋.

Prompt: A silent film in color. A deaf romance. An explosion of sound at the film’s end.
