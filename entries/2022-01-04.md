Stayed up last night. First day of class. See how we do on the math test. Feels like I’m dying. Pull it together. Went to Weth for lunch. Ran into Will and Defne. Remember why. Rhetoric, Grammar and Logic. Did a minute of Bring Sally Up. Went out with Belew and the preps to Swasey. Lazy on swasey today. Demosthenes. Got barred from the StuCo assembly. Kasou Taishou. Cleaned up my room (Kind of). Examine pendulum for inspiration. Going back to the Classics. Talk to people. Multi-form soul.

Train in mind and body, and go forth into the world.
