Ran into Leena at breakfast. Talked about Hobbes. Went to Calc. Word games. Ate with Ricky, Matteo, Val and UWC kids, Met Ryan. Discontinuous Constituencies. Mock trial time. Run our stuff. Cut our hair. Feeling majorly sore. Engage in recollection as if meditation.

A memory came back to us: Cold fall days at Fay. Walking over the hill. Tie checks before breakfast. New England winters, Mostafa and snow. The drive back to 24 Crescent Drive. Having milk downstairs in the evening.
