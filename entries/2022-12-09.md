Met Ethan for breakfast at Cathey. Ripples on the rink. Slipped on ice. Sat in the Stuart cubicles. All to ourselves. A trip to the Garfield park conservatory? Hieronymus Bosch’s triptychs. Looked at Sophia’s essay on Antigone. Thought about our transfer app. Wound up at Woodlawn. Ate with Alex and Leah. Coconut stew. Had a nice long conversation with Niko by the windows. Ran into Cory. Did our laundry. Thought about petroglyphs and birds of preys, vultures, scavengers. Hung out with Gabby. Forgot we could chortle. Shower in the morning. 

Memento: Our compass—knowing that idleness destroys, turn our mind towards production. Make it our life’s mission to engage in dialectic and participate in the evolution of thought. Youtube. Podcast. Interviews.
