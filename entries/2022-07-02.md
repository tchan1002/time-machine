Day 80  
Woke up feeling good. 80 days left now to stay on track and look good. The betterhelp bathroom monologue. Made a successful grocery trip. Got a couple ounces of sculpey. Oranges and spinach. We can make toast for breakfast now. Sausage-garlic-spinach-  
spaghetti for dinner. Meditations upon a return from the grocers. Ted Kaczynski. Uninhabitable cities. The Labadie Collection at UMich. Scallion party. Leaf. Put some veggies in every meal. Eat oranges for a snack. Blowtorch meat. Viewfinder. Kung Fu Hustle. Went down a rabbit hole. 我的少女时代. 那些年. Find the Connecticut delegation at convention. Light rain outside. Kingsmen. The Passion of Christ. Shall good triumph over evil? Temptations in the desert. Muslim Jesus still alive. Christopher Hitchens and Historical Materialism. Apparent thunderstorms. Went for a six miler when the storm died down. Light rain on the track. Felt good. Ask about their favourite movies on coolcat. Oranges. How sweet they were when we got to Exeter. Momentary melancholies. Maybe we’ll finish up stranger things. Bin Laden. Bread and butter. Poach eggs tomorrow. 20 something days left. We’re in the middle of the season. A memory of Ms. Wang’s defense of us in her sixth grade Chinese class. Coloured glasses.
