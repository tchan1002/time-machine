Woke up and brushed our teeth. Met Anne at noon. Knocked on Sophia’s door. Had lunch with Anne at Lao Sze Chuan. Beef short-ribs and Mapo Tofu. Word Avalanches. Walked around Navy Pier, Big Anchor. Really nice day out. Anne drove us home. Sat down in Sophia’s room. Zofie came in. Went down to Tiffins and then to Hutch with Clancy. Got a poke bowl. Walked back with Clancy. Visited his room. An unlit cigarette between our teeth, the fault in our stars. All the vonnegut heads. Lyfted to the reg. Alexa gave us a tour of snitchcock. Second dinner in the Hitchcock kitchen. Sat down in the Reynolds club. Read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Met Ryan and stood outside of Alpha Delt. Not our scene. Lyfted back to ihouse, played ping pong and cried. Called Ryan, then caught up with Jasper on the phone. 

Snippet: *The gods giveth and taketh away\! Jasper, the gods giveth and taketh away\!*  
Think we’re going through some pretty severe Gabby withdrawal.
