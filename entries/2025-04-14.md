Back to work. Caught up and submitted Capital in the morning. Pectore secured at the end of [[Papam]]. Interviewed Jona and George from Rise Reforming. Stopped by Windy Build. Colin gave a lecture on launching. One can launch many timesâ€”all one needs is to push stuff out. We are much tired but things are good.
