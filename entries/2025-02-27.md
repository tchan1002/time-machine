Slept in. Showered and went to class. Domble is a great word for "book", and poozy a great one for "slow". What a poozy domble. Joshua Foer's Memory palace. Read and write widely. Applied to windy build—we can document building Who's On? there. Went down to Cathey. Lunch with Mel, talked Debt, Planetary Parade, and Joy. Plans to make Funk's cereal happen. The world in our mind waits break free. Updated our website with Requests to Build. Stayed up too late tonight. GTB.

Exit the kafkaesque caverns. Working this past summer in South taught us that the principle of efficiency is thoughtfulness and care. Waste and evil arise out of apathy and inattention. Μηδεν αγαν.

The quintessential middle school exercise of "This I Believe" may have had wide ramifications. We're going to Indonesia on a whim? If we CNVC, we might not do Oaxaca.

Notes from Mel:
- Say high to the locksmith, the baker, the fishermen.
- Venmo has done irreparable harm by getting us to settle debts with friends.
- Check out are.na
- [[Funk's Cereal]]: Ginseng, acai flavors?

[[Siloed Mind]]: If memory and communication are just preservations along the spatial and temporal axis—memory is an empathy. A transmission into light. A shuffling of information between the structures of the brain is analogous to the shuffling of information between ourselves.

Etymology of consideration. Con sidera "with the stars?"
Tomorrow seven planets align. Last chance for us to exit the solar system via gravitational swing.

[[Nowhere Collective]]: "Does stuff just accumulate for you? We'll come and clean your stuff out for free. @uchidestroys." How do we leverage arts and media to give us coverage?

[[CB]] and Attention and WM are overlapping: semantic networks. Our long term memory may employ nested parent-child categories. c.f Ruby on Rails, children classes inherit characteristics from parent classes.

Big pain point for us recently: parsing our journal to take out zingers.

The Spiral (Calvino)
