**Day 56**   
Simple as a doormat, it’s serendipity. Our problem is we keep chasing soundbites. Pureed tomatoes, made a butter chicken paste. Three big painful X’s on the calendar? Fired up League of Legends—that’s how you know it’s been dire. Night run. Cool out. 5 miles down the backroads. Cicadas thrumming like the engines of taxi cabs. Felt something we haven’t in a while. Downed three glasses of milk. Showered. Played protobowl.

We used to read neruda—what happened? This has not been our brat summer.
