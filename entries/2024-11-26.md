A day of no electronics. We realized we had two big urges to beat: the urge to record and the urge to check up on messages from other people. We have to beat both in order to 1. live in the present and 2. to stop living reactionarily. 

In terms of what happened: we read through most of Ishiguro's Remains of the Day. In the morning, we ran for about a mile before pain set in. Went down to Audi's to pick up scallions and a gallon of milk from mom. Met a man there who let us go first in line. Talked brieflyâ€”he said he was spending thanksgiving with his two daughters. In the evening, we sewed up our pants. Rediscovered Chloe's mp3 player which had the Duff installed. Chloe was in our room digging up old gadgets.

This was one of the few days that we were really awake and realized how fragmentary our consciousness had become. We do not have a mind of a lion (yet), we are more like a frightened animal. It would do us some good to dopamine detox further.
