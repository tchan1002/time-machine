**Day 106**  
Hyperconnected, which is goodâ€”but we have to make things happen too. Had breakfast. Skibidi Labels. *In Event of Moon Disaster.* Took grad pictures for Daniel and his cats. Had dinner with Anna. Talked desired paths. Sat with Mari and Quincey for a bit behind the law school. Talked consciousness. I Origins. Grabbed our camera. Met Moran and Kat outside Reynolds. Urbex at the Damen Silos. Chicago past the tall grass. Way to start this summer. Got back after one. Showered and gave ourselves a thorough wash.

Build amigo.
