Woke up at 5:00. Finished our Psych homework. Slept in. Read Felski before our Psych class. Left to meet with Christ Fugelstad. Look into Trinity College Dublin’s course offerings. Mention that we’re a fourth year needing civ to graduate. Moved to Ex Lib for our Maroon Meeting. [[Shawn Quek]], avid Beli user, Singapore. Took [[Tae]]'s headshots. Went back home for a quick nap. Reynolds shift. We're a guide, way finder. Reach out to [[Parnika]]. [[Finn]] stopped by to talk with us—about mentorship and drowning cities. Had dinner. Have to slip back into hyper-efficiency. We've just been watching TV.  A cop, a homeless man. [[10-21 BM Shift]] Closed up shop. Ladies at Pret let us bring home a free salad. Talked an hour and a half with Daniel Mata. He recounted an episode of seeing 6 wolves at daylight in Yellowstone, and the journey the Brothers Karamazov had taken him on, so that he could not stop thinking about death two weeks after.
