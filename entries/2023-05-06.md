Saturday. Sat down at an empty Harper cafe. Mycology. The 1904 Olympic Marathon. Scav— went to the reverse-reverse game show. Grabbed a little food at Hutch and headed back. Might be sick for real. Took a long nap. Had tofu stew for dinner. The Rocky theme. 

*Because we were young and we were restless.* 

Snippet: Kapil told me that the first time he heard a Flaming Lips’ song was when he was 16, growing up in the suburbs of Wheaton. The song, *She Don’t Use Jelly*, was on the radio when his mom taught him how to drive in a blue 1989 Toyota Camry. Kapil told me that his mom always laughed because she thought the lyrics were ridiculous. “She passed away two years later. It’s one of my favourite memories of my mother.*”* he said.
