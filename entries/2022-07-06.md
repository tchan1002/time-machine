Day 76   
“Magnet” the dog. We could be broke and eat lettuce all day. Kind of struggling to not think about Jacqueline. Chiisana Koi no Uta. Go and make rice. Gravity lights. Look at PL19. Cook celery. Use cool cat. Celery, Ground beef and Cumin. Sent over AP scores. Rescheduled our Road Test. Future Insured. Rome and Chartreuse. A critique of Friends. Fresh off the boat. [www.jstor.org/stable/40642973](http://www.jstor.org/stable/40642973). Went down a rabbithole. The incestuous in-group dynamic of Friends. Community’s got our vote for best. Dan Harmon’s just a genius. A career in television. Think about it. Ted Lasso, Freaks and Geeks. Knocked up. Jude Apatow. The Henriad. The King. The King of Staten Island. Father Stu. Mark Wahlberg. Refresh and recover. Forever and ever, a hundred years.

Go down and get eggs  
Shred cabbage, stir fry with ground beef.   
Cook rice.
