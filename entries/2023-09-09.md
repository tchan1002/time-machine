Infinity pool. Move in Day. Walked to South to grab our keys. Limbo-esque. Met Reese and Jeremy from. Went down to Logan Square with Elijah for a Dumpling Fest. BIBBAK. Joined a snake dance. Woman in a red wingsuit. A view of the city on the drive back. Look into the Deanâ€™s Fund. Bones and All. Moved into our room for the year. They gave us a phone and couch. Watched a plane takeoff. Our citadel of solitude. Up on the 10th floor. Slept.
