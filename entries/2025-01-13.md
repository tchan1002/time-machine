Breakfast. Ate at Bart with Mel. Green book. Field Museum. Plan for a gathering. Returned Colin's tripod. Sat down with Shikhar at Booth. [[CB]]. Something came up for Paul. Sat in Polsky to bang notes out. Bart dinner. Maroon meeting. Took the bus up to meet Holden. The Bean. Had chipotle. Gothic Target near Wilson. Talked public places. Athletic club.

Mel's recs: Check out NTS radio. Coco Maria. Bill Brewster. 
Into the city, snowed out.
A mind focused, free from fear.
Retire boring clothing choicesâ€”seize the day, make our lives extraordinary.

Holden:
The history of the homeless is an effective history of public places.
Theoretical knowledge vs practical knowledge. 
Religion is essentially public but publicness is not essentially religious.

Finalized:
Human Communication
Attention and Working Memory
Consumer Behavior
Internet Art

Song: Dogwood Blossom by Fionn Regan.
