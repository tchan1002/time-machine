Day 15  
Boarded a tour bus. A view of Marina Bay Sands. Met Kelvin at SC Ventures/Audax. Trek ended at DRW. Lady was brutal but hilarious. Algo-trading. Latency sensitivity. *Just like caring for a baby.* Went out to karaoke with the group. Gave a rendition of Yellow with Lawrence. Grabbed dinner at Newton. Hawker stands. Fried oyster pancakes and soursop juice. 

Avian inspired fashion. (What we called wearing our blazer weird)  
Dhoby Gaut’em nuts in your mouth.   
We’re just an instrument—an agent of the universe.
