Woke up and walked to class. Did our linguistics PSet. Nisus and Euryalus. Flora and fauna. Sat downstairs in the reg. Caught up on our hum discussion posts. Napped in the reg. Bananas and soy milk. Met with Beymer. Pass-Fail is a go. Reach out. Emailed Moreau about Pass Fail. Called about our green card. Stopped by Medici’s before our midnight soccer game. 6-3 against the Casnerites. Went to Julie’s apartment for Moktoberfest. Devoured pretzels the whole night. Don't Stop Believing. Gabby came by our door. Had a silly convo.

Literature requires an unfurling.   
Does an almond come from a peach pit?  
Living our life like some sort of a dramatic character.
