Slept in. Caught up on sleep. Australia by the Shins. A series of immolations. We’ve been insular—have to get out there. Went to Noah’s for Boomcrash. Got Nolan on our project. 

Sliced bread merch. Senior send off at the point.  
Infomercial for a demonic walkie talkie

The Whale: an invisible person finds that they can communicate with others via a walkie talkie.   
Act 1: Waves gently crash against the beach, two voices off screen talk about “the loneliest whale in the world”, who is cut off from other whales because it sings at a different frequency. The camera pans, and we see the back of “the whale” sitting on the beach.   
Act 2: The whale goes through their routine completely invisible to the people around them. He is so nonexistent that even his room is occupied by other people who don’t notice his presence.  
Act 3: The whale finds a walkie talkie and plays with it. It makes static which others can hear. The whale realizes for the first time in their life that they might be able to get others to notice him.
