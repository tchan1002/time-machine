Woke up and walked to Calc. Had lunch at Bart with Fredric. Calc test on Tuesday. Sent out info about Badminton IMs. Draft our Big IM email. Read watchmen. Jesus as superman. Seoul Tacos. Went to our watchmen reading group. Met Alex from London. Ran to Mock practice. Figured out Engine theory? Wrote Shahidâ€™s direct. Read up on cross examinations. Hurried over to sliced bread for an eclair. Midnight soccer tomorrow.

Get back to writing commentary.
