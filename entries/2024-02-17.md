Woke up for our Campus Catalyst interview. Two nice convos today: Louis about animation studios, Francisco about just everything. Think we have a good understanding of ourselves? Cheese in Ida Noyes. 2 hours of talking to potential RAs. Alec’s birthday at Il Porcellino’s. Had a shrimp scampi. Went back to Francisco’s room and talked. The Bhagavad Gita. How we oscillate. “Right action is without selfish attachment to outcome”

Notes on our convo with Louis: *Creativity Inc*. The Story of Pixar. Matthew Luhn’s *How to Leverage Hollywood Storytelling in Business.* Starting one’s own animation studio. Kubo and the two strings, manual techniques in animation.
