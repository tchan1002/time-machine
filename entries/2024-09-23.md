Woke up at 8:00. Went down for breakfast. Talked SB politics with Courtney. Stopped by Logan. Acquired a monopod. Jollibee at Masons. All the RAs walking over. Felt like part of a big family. Really really nice. Napped on the couch. Woke up to Collinâ€™s phone hovering inches above our face for a .5. Building tour.
