Great white plumes coming out the vents of rooftops. Went down to do our laundry. Packed. Move to the reg at 1. Cut it really really close with Aabir at the airport. 5:50 arrival for a 6:30 boarding. On to Copenhagen.

Steve job's last email.
A big thank you to our uber driver Muyassar and for all the strangers who let us through
