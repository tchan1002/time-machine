[[Keep in Mind]]

Morning. Boarded a bus to Chinatown. Returned texts. Texted Lara. D-Nik Table at Minghin. Walked around with James. Called Matteo about MODA x (P)rind. Posted a substack update. Ippolito Caffi's eclipse. Talked with Kimani about China and Doc Film finance intracacies. Assessing theater-goers WTP. Heated up turnip cakes with gochujang. Worked on Flag. Stayed up late talking with Ada. 

Community is making collisions possible.

The death of USAID opens a vacuum for Chinese interests.
Wigwam as our communal ideation wing. 
Some beauty in the idea that every little thing has led to this moment.

“History is malleable. The greatness of our work will ensure that our work will never be known”
The game is being thoughtful and remembering to be.
