#### Must Do's

Flight day. Breakfast. Last Soto Ayam—now we know how it’s done. Left in the morning with Amber for the airport. And then there were two. Helped Amber pack in the airport, she suffered a sudden nose bleed. An hour to Changi, then five to Hong Kong. Watched Mickey 17, then parts of the minecraft movie. The latter cracked us up. Aboo and Gonggong came to pick us up at the Hong Kong airport. Took the last bus back home to Sheung Shui.

The Singaporean flight attendants wore a blue floral batik. 
We found ourselves understanding the indonesian.
