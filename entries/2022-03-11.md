Creator, maintainer, and undertaker. Lorca. The beauty of the world, the paragon of animals, what is this quintessence of dust? Osmosis Jones. Vi veri veniversum vivus vici. Because ideas are bulletproof. Finished V for Vendetta. Judas in Heaven. Catcher in the Rye. Why the focus on phony things and people? Kinda feeling this Holden Caulfield sort of thing. Glad to hear Holden enjoyed the Great Gatsby. Sally’s there but Old Jane’s just an idea. The preservation of innocence. All the “f\*ck you” signs in the world. Finished Catcher in the Rye. Causality protects itself. Felt lazy today. Get a good rest and go out for an early run tomorrow. Computational linguistics. Got some pushups in. What is it about showers that bring such immense clarity? Protect our teeth.
