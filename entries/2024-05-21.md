Shift gears: reviewed for our Poli Sci final. Met with Sophie about stamps then Alex Banayan. 6 degrees of difference. We’re showing Alex around Chicago in June. We trod, we’ll fly through this week. Got out of Polisci feeling decent. 1 down, 4 more to go. Declined library jobs. Living in a South apartment this summer. Slept.

Otis Gordon, new Jaq Lai. 

In the early morning we heard the birds sing/ and the yellow of the windows fed the yellow of the moon. Really we stayed up and watched 6 episodes of the bear.
