#### Must Do's
- [x] Consumer Behavior prompt
- [x] Letter to the internet

Kishi Bashi's Omoiyari. The price of a dozen eggs has overthrown empires. Caught up on work. Sat in Polsky and finished up our CB homework. A little time for us to breathe. Internet art—played around with a navbar. Via back with Annie. Last staff meeting with Mason. We've actually been pretty on top of our readings this quarter.

Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs the band.
We have such limited time—have to prioritize.

[[CB]]: In the mid-70s, anthropologists followed shoppers around grocery stores to find that end-caps received more exposure than aisles. Now advertisers are retroactively inserting coke cans on seinfeld reruns. 

[[Webapp Ideas]]: semantic mapping using chatgpt. 
procedure: 
1. generate tags based off of init files. 
2. give each file a distance-value for each tag
3. list files by closest distance-values.
4. generate new tags when necessary (above certain distance-value?)
