Busy day, we’ll probably survive though. Messed up on the hand in, but we’re still alive. Goldengrove unleaving. The Jabberwocky. Cohesive Devices. Generative Engines. Beowulf. Guttural Anglo Saxons. Finished Nicaragua research during the long block. Sat with Grace during E format. Cough acting up a bit today. Going to the health center. Took a long nap. Had a really good night with Grace today at the track meet. Saw Will house with Shalom. Talked to David and Colbert. Called Aboo. Olive farm. Today was a really splendid day. Talked to a lot of friends and had a lot of fun. Extremely sore calves though. Zhou Enlai.

Cafe de Flore. 

So much of our love is lost on benches. An old man came and told us the wooden bench is warmer. And so we laughed, said thank you and moved because otherwise it would be rude. I asked you to shove me, as if it was proof that you felt something too.
