**Day 94**  
Woke up. Grabbed lunch with Nick. Wolff’s Flea Market this Sunday? There’s an extraordinary density of high schoolers in Woodlawn dining commons. Hong Kong tailors. Claimed the spare room as our office. Gave ourselves a haircut. Cleaned up. We’ve got version 1 of a counter app. TJ’s chicken tikka masala is up there. Ran with Manar to the point. Because we wanted to be transformed\! Took a dip in the lake before running back. Showered and went to Anderson’s. Adam Belew. Meat Club, the inn, browning basement, so many things came back to us.

Crippling hot sauce  
That’s how you do CPG

Song: One Foot by Walk the Moon

Respect good media, because we allow it to take time away from us.   
**Task of the day: finish coding counter widget.**
