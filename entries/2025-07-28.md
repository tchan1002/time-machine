#### Must Do's
- [x] Fill out past three days
Class in the morning. Last class with Guru Kanya. Learned emotions. [[Rasa]] is both taste and feel. Will be our pick for the name of an Indonesian restaurant if we were ever to open one back home. Soto Ayam at Ibu Rita's with Maela. Grabbed a second lunch with Fatumah at Chinese hotplate, had ayam hotplate and cumi topeng (calamari). Dropped off laundry. *Kurang bisa?* Napped at our kos. Got back home. Washed our face and had a clean shave. Gourame at dinner. Survivor interview tonight. Head out with Aurora to meet Trisha and Amber at a cafe near school. Night walk. Did laps round Sanata Dharma. Amber asked how we think we'd changed. Gratitude perhaps, for things we considered necessities. Trisha talked about realizing the full extent of her agency. Notes on a Balinese cockfight.

Fill in past three days. Have been quite a lot going on.
Get a pair of scissors to cut our hair.
Read, run, write, workout, stay clean.

What is the life that *we* want? It can be material but we need to chase after it. 
At the Alun Alun Kidul, the only way through is to close our eyes and run.
Only a week left in Jogja. Compile list of favourite places. Learn a couple of recipes before we go. Practice thick description.
