**Day 8**  
Slept in. Watched Clerks. Visited Josie’s. Sliced bread plans underway. *The Hum Lab.* Clancy introduced us to Dan Wriggins’s rendition of Utah Phillips’ “I Think of You”, which is honestly very nice. Figure out stickers. Must build. Could not sleep. Went up. Watched Lost in Translation with Clancy until 2:00 in the morning. 

Hum Lab Media.
