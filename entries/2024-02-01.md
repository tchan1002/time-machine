Nice weather out. Went to religion. Settled in the Stuart cubicles and did our micro pset. God we’re hungry. Ran into Guido outside of the Reg and grabbed lunch. Did our laundry. A fog crept in as we walked down to Booth for class. Sliced Bread. Had fourth meal. 

Sandcastles of existence, we are a vox clamantis in deserto.   
Deuteronomy 30:12 “It is not up in heaven”: you shall go out and break bread with strangers.  
Thought of that time when we walked with Mom down to New Haven. God it was cold, our hands in our pockets.
