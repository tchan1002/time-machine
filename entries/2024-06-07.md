**Day 105**  
Did our laundry. Booked thanksgiving tickets home. Knocked out. Had a good nap on the office couch. The search for Brett Farmer. Steak and eggs. Recouped. Fired up some potstickers from TJ’s. Put some gochujang on them. Was honestly fire. Midway midnight club. Ran. Have to get out there—runs sprout epiphanies. 

Amigo: time spent with other people is never time wasted. what we’re really thinking about is just getting a bunch of strangers together to do stuff (no matter the medium\!)

Challenge: knowing when our friends are free to hang out  
Solution: T Wang’s widget. Let people update their status and be one phone call away. Could even pivot to a work management system.
