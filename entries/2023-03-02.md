Woke up and walked to math. Seven against Thebes, the quest is always an impossible dream. Had lunch with taps Isabella at Bart. Settled on the A-level of the reg. Read Pale Fire. The miracle of a lemniscate. Parhelia, bookmarked at 25\. Drifted around Bart with Leah. Sat with Adan and Chris. Met Jess for our date at Plein Air. Grabbed a hot chocolate and sat down in a corner. Showed up to wopo. Suffered a bad cramp. Went to fourth meal with Louis. Took a lyft home. 

Farewell to weth, if phantom fingers could scrawl on its walls the words “we were here”.  
Know this is no art, we mean only to bare our heart so that it may be judged by the scales of eternal life.
