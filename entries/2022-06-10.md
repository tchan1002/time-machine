Day 102  
Woke up and drove to the DMV. Have got to work on our turns. Fruit Juice. Fingers crossed for campus crew in the fall. Make 1 to 4 reading time. 9-10 Ludus. 10-11 Agon Wipe out? The eighties were a funny time. 35 dollars left on our gift card. Phoebus. Apply to two other programs as well. To be a teenager in the fifties. Think we’re halfway through Oedipus. Went down to Chase with mom. Apply for a credit card online. Appellation d’origine contrôlée. PIN 7412\. Do Anki tonight. Read Ludus. Regain our fluency in Latin over the summer. Fell asleep, and woke up again at 8:00. The summer of our renewal. Have got to get our ATnT fixed. Couple things to do but not feeling up to it today. Rest and tackle things in the morning. Form a plan around living alone. Steve Harrington. Find a nice jacket and some jeans. Joined a Chicago MTG discord. Phi Beta Kappa. Meal planning may not be a bad idea. Drink water. Living alone might get scary. Zoom friends. Yuri’s our favorite character now.

“This is gonna sound terrible but I play MagicArena.”  
“What misery to be wise when wisdom profits nothing.”

Thinking about the time when Eric Obukhanich bought a ton of pelmeni from a Russian grocer and put it in the common room. Twenty boys feasting together.
