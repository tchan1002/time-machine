Woke up and studied math at Bart. We’ll see how the midterm went. Had lunch with Fredric. Walked through UChi med. Booked a health center appointment for Monday 8:20. Worked on Pre-reg in Harper. Text and Performance. Email Beymer. Caught a bite at Cathey. Ran into Mikael. Wowed by our linguistics lecture. Had a poke bowl at Hutch with Josh. Pack tonight for the weekend. Had our last pre-stack practice. Ran our Navarra cross. Fourth meal. Alex Valbuena and Isabella walked us back to ihouse. A Letter from Holden. Catullus. 

Little chapel, gothic faces. The quad at sundown, a village of lights.   
“In the corals' bone kingdom his skin calcifies.” (Omeros, 1.8.3)

Like a well oiled machine.
