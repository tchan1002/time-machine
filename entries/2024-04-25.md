Pulled out an old hendecasyllabic verse. *Sum suffenus, semper solus.* Dropped by Reynolds to order our dumplings. Make purchases that will change how we live. Sat in the bond courtyard for a bit. Took headshots for Kathryn. Got our headshots done. Had soup with Lucy. Tim Han. Mag launch tomorrow. Run errands.
