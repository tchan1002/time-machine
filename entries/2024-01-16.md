Cereal in a cup. We wrote such a good essay on prosthetics last year. Made our first set of investments in food delivery and ride-sharing services. Sent an email out to Jay from the puppet fest. Joe showed us their room and collection of beyblades. Secured AV equipment for open mic. Dirt red. Turn hiccups into opportunities, we’re a game-maker. Looked through Martina’s pitch deck, put in our questions. Went to Firebird and then Fire Escape. Adventures with David Lara. Came back and made pasta for the house. Put on our chef hat. Thursday and Friday night parties with Joseph Mooney this week. The moon hung there, orange. 

Snippet: wordplay keeps Socrates alive, because our words construct alternate realities that deny the permanence of death. If we consider the thermodynamics of the soul: energy never lost, only transformed. We are just left to wonder if it is still meaningful that the substance of the soul is eternal given…
