**Day 85**  
Slept in. Grabbed breakfast. Shift. Went up to Audreyâ€™s after. Hung out on the swings by 47th. Played pickleball. Lost horribly to Elyssa, Shelby and Becca. Was fun though. Audrey made us some pasta and we watched the Bear. Dinner with Rachel monday. Watched the Trump-Biden debate. 

Memory of us being in New York when Obama was debating Mitt Romney.
