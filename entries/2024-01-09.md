Little sleep. Woke up and went to Kuvia. Did our laundry. Showed up to Licha’s class. The hermeneutics of suspicion. Poisoned Heart by the Ramones. David Burnett’s photos with a Holga. Had a really good convo with Joseph Mooney over lunch about DSP and entertainment. Settled in the A level with Kody. Met Suhani, who did CNVC last year. *Get to know Scott Metcalf.* Went to Micro. Had a quick bite at bart with Matthew Lee. Grabbed a couple old issues of Sliced Bread from our room. Hijacked a table at Ida. Maroon/Firebird/Sliced Bread rotation. Joseph introduced us to people. Got to know Michael McClure of the Maroon. Ate a bit with Natalie before our editor’s meeting—big quarter for us. The word is *enterprise*. Plans for an open mic third week. Globe lamps like moons on the midway. Daniel Fecko. Called Jason. Grateful for the help of strangers. Ziggy’s invite. Met up with Anderson to go visit the Iron Key Society. Big thoughts about pong. Soberness, it’s stark. *What’s your name? Where are you from? What school did you go to?* Big Groton, Hotchkiss populations. Anderson recommended us the Holdovers, Alexander Payne.

Memo: Give out compliments freely. Seek out and connect with people we find cool. Start conversations with strangers. Expect nothing. Never be angry, always build bridges.
