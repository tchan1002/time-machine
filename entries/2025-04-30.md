#### Must Do's
- [x] Kapital 

Day 26. Shave and look clean. 1% improvements vs 1% degeneration. Self-help chicken soup. Last day of [[Papam]]. A Renaissance painting ending. Near-death at the hands of the Pope and Sanseverino. Popped up massively late to Kapital. [[Papam]] afterparty, three generation of Corella's. Glad we put on a show. Rain started coming in the afternoon, made everything green. Churros after dinner. Chris Furlough came by study break. Went to bed early. Maybe tomorrow we won't be severely behind.

The story of chipotleâ€”it came out of a side project.
Sick + no running + no exercise is an awful combo.
When do we get back up?
Catch up on everything today.

Bojo the midpart, get some volume back.
