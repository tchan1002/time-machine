Went to Religion. Submitted our micro pset and took the day off. Went back to North and watched the Great Gatsby. These sunsets. Grabbed milk and cookies for our Sliced Bread meeting. Thought of the milk and lamb we had once in the desert. Made pasta and experimented with candied lemon slices. Was a monster of a dinner. Egyptian black tea. Picked up clean sheets. Good leap day. Hopped on a call with Thomas and Arhon. Stayed up and helped Arhon with his college apps.

The universe is something that sees itself\!
