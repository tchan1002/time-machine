Walked outside and thought we were home. The morning air sank around us. Seagulls outside of North. Watched Titus 1999\. Took our galaxies Quiz. Grabbed some Greek Yogurt and walked home. Write our Hum draft during class. Spanish boots of spanish leather. The lament of Frederico Garcia Lorca. Khalil Gibran. Had dinner down at Tiffins. Spicy pork Dama Bowl. DId some pull-ups. Read the Prophet. Called Chloe. Borrowed swim goggles from Gabby. 

Stop motion, the perfection of a freeze frame.   
*Last summer I lived alone, and in the nights would run in the streets and come upon the woods.*  
We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.  
Your blood and my blood is naught but the sap that feeds the tree of heaven.
