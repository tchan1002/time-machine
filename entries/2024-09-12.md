**Day 9**  
Morning. Met with Shayna Beymer. Onions for breakfast. Had a good talk with Lincoln about impactful careers. The interests of consumers are worth protecting. Followed Lincoln and Clancy up to Thorndale. Dice Dojo’d. Stopped by a Thai supermarket, where Clancy sampled various drinks, including Korean ginseng. 7 Pho restaurants in a two block radius. *They’re eating the pets.* Back in Hyde Park. Skated over to Trader Joe’s for ground beef. Watched Der Untergang with Clancy and crew.

On eating meat. It’s not that people are bad, ignorant or even selfish, it’s just really hard to think all the time.
