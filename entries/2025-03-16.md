No time is promised. Sent Chloe off to Union Station after noon. Shooting an AI conference when we get back to school. Assembled pictures for our portfolio. Photography we do dabble.
Beef up for Grad Season. Money is to be made. Pushup-failure cycled. Went out for a run. May have seen a peacock. Add/drop tomorrow. Published Siloed Mind I. Bought one of Kavya's art—Grandma Reading. We deal in art now. Slight rain outside. See how Sotheby's does their promo materials. They are the masters of selling a story. Get ourselves a Tamie Okuyama. Nobuyoshi Araki.
