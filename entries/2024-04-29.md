Wrote a card for dad. Interviewed with the metra. Went to our sliced bread edâ€™s meeting. Breadies Only: Barbecue and Bevs. Tents pitched on the quad. Paul Alivisatos with a careful response. Crashed mid authoritarian regimes. Soup rouses the soul. Walked back up to North. Napped. Go and get some food. Dropped by the tents and hung out with the Maroon. 

Secure summer funding.
