Woke up at 10, walked to math. Suki Waterhouse. Had lunch with Fredric. The Thomas Grant meal, Chicken, Guac and Rice. Been eating Kosher these past weeks. The A level alcoves of the reg—a prime film-viewing experience. Looped Vale into watching Avatar 2 with us. Had dinner with Mateo at Bart. Felt slow at Mock practice. Shared our music with Isabella. Borrowed swim trunks from Ryan. Ran into Audrey, Jesenia and Vale in the Wendt common room. Talked with Erin at Tiffins. Played pool with Adan. Sleep\! Rush tomorrow. 

Moby Dick and Avatar 2\. Amrita, Tulkun spermaceti.  
Scott L. Feld’s friendship paradox, visualizations of social networks.

Dreamt that we were back at Exeter. Tagged onto a cross country meet with Tendo and rode in Newbould’s car. Sunset as we traveled down the zig-zag steps of a mountain. Quickly moving before us, like shadow puppets, the tall red towers of some European town—Hamburg, we called it. Then when the sun had come up, to some other part of the city, two green banks of a river that we had walked along in some other dream.
