Woke up and typed up our Moby Dick analysis. Sent Professor Fenley an email. Wrote to Coach Sam. Seneca’s Medea. *Look at the bees, how life perpetuates life*. Had lunch at Bartlett. Cream of mushroom soup. Sat with Alec, caught up with Nikhil. Skipped out on Galaxies to get some rest. Got back our Hum paper before TAPS, another W. Fen and Vonnegut’s Hocus Pocus. Marxist thought. Had dinner with Emberlynn and Hunter at Cathey. Had a second dinner at Woodlawn with Rohan. Think we’re stumbling. Jasper called. 

*Uhlmans and Stillwells. Where’s the ice cream place here?*   
Memento: Check in with people. Always express gratitude.
