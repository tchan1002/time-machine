Day 70  
Donated to Exeter. Set up a recurring donation. Got dressed, wore pants for Credit Suisse. Had Dim Sum with Aboo. Settled in a To Kwa Wan library cubicle on the 6th floor. Looked at Jasper’s modern myth. Checked out Nhan’s Viet Narrative podcast. Had afternoon tea with the grandparents at Maxin. Went out to Nam Cheong. Talked to Yu Dong as we picked up meals from the restaurant. Gave our little spiel to Credit Suisse. Had dinner. Brie Larson in Scott Pilgrim. Went back home. 

Working out of a single room in the warehouse building. “A material charity”, linking sponsors to beneficiaries. 

Meta: Revisited a lot of our past entries. They seem strange? Think our language has definitely changed and shifted, if not slightly. Have to remember and stay close to the living communion of thought.
