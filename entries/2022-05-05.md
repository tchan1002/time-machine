Meeting with Myers at 2.15 in the afternoon. “Fringe” Quality of life. Shot by a stream of water whilst entering Weth. Sent email for CSO. Met with Myers. Infans and infandum. Felt out of it. Maintain hydration. Fry eggs. Cut our hair. Took a nap. Went to CSO, then CCC. Read Stardust. Classics Dinner coming up May 15th. Lot’s of dinners coming up. We fought tonight. First RTW. Trust that’s how the system works. McLaughlin tried too. Went out a bit short today. Stretch out. Ate Nachos. People taking the Assassin’s game very seriously. Been a really decent week. Nearing grad now like a meteor drifting at a black hole’s horizon. Local Legend on Gilman Street. Keep an eye on XC messenger. Call on Saturday. Shin splints?

“We are rightfully wary”  
Pyre comes from pur meaning fire, so when you say fire pyre you’re really saying fire fire.

Myers notes:  
Switch to present  
Birth—Rising from the Crypt  
Struggle to understand. “Your father? No you’ve never had a father.”  
Incremental steps  
Enhance the themes of time and eternity.   
Graveyard, Egyptian sunrise imagery.   
Why the memory of a wake—Death.  
Zero suffers the same due because it too is unable to die.
