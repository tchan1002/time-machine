Day 15  
Had salmon cream-cheese baguettes for breakfast. Worked on our spreadsheet. The Bombyx Mori. Go thrifting with Chloe. Get away from screens. Listen to music. Checked in to our dental appointment. College people on the coolcat. Adopted a philosophy of openness. Talked to Zofie and Sumin. Had a really nice convo with Devin. Some really cool people out there. Read Will Park’s *Into a New Infinity* again. Making our stand now. Return to activity, have to be outside. Ryan Gosling’s black shirt and gold tie in La La Land. 

People at Chicago: Alex and Lea. Devin and Sergio (Pool bros\!). Richard, Adan, Andre. Ray, Aymane, Jack Monday, Joe, Rohan. Fredric, Mateo, Anamelia. Isabella, mock people. Reach out to Elijah and get to know Thomas. Phil, Min, Sumin, Zofie, Seth, Giancarlo.

Adapting coolcat for the advent of college friends, doctoring past entries. Can’t have people knowing we’re a no-good mind-dweller.
