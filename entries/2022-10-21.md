Got our few hours of sleep. Got dressed and walked to section. Had our writing seminar. Walt Whitmanâ€™s giant head. The art in Harper. Meet with Tommy on Monday. Clam chowder. Sat in a reg cubicle. The origin of curling stones. Napped for a bit. Akira. Bocced with Thomas out on the lawn. The Vorrh Trilogy. Midnight Soccer. Got beat by Casner. Reminiscent of our 7-1 loss to Fessenden. Band of Brothers. 

Assuage my pangs of hunger.  
Let the shepherd shear his sheep.
