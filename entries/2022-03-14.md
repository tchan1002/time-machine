Picked the car up with mom. Took the bus to New Haven. Frank Pepe’s. Wandered around town with Daniel. Read inside a bookstore. Met Stephen and walked around Yale. Good day. A good deal of walking too. Earthlings. Pachinko. Blood Meridian. Thomas Pynchon. 10 things I hate about you. “I burn, I pine, I perish”

Conversation at the New Haven Green bus stop: Met a man who worked in meat packaging. “See here, this fajita sauce?” he said. “Made it last night with chicken, and I’m going to make it again for my prayer group this Tuesday.”
