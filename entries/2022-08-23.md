Day 28  **Highlight: A Silent Voice**  
A Silent Voice. Dis Manibus. Eat breakfast. Write Eggs. Odd Jobs on Reddit. Left EVPN. Find ways to make passive income. Cold calling, network. Create farms. Carl Jung. Pack light for Chicago. Went out to Home Depot. Apparent thunderstorms. The Lady of Shalott. Have got to read Tennyson. Collected our textbooks. Try Lingua Latina. Kind of like Sarah Rudenâ€™s translation of the Aeneid. Looked at some old pictures. Make better use of our days. 14 until New York, 28 until school. Brush our teeth. Reset.
