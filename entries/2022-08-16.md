Day 35  
Leaving for New York today. Woke up and put our clothes in the laundry. Charge our devices. Shower and shave. Three weeks till September 6th. Work towards it. Cook now. Leave at two. Bring some food for the road. Take care of health stuff. Remember to grab earphones. Is Catullus an incel? Incel literature. Went on Omegle. Purely Dionsysian. Ran into David Kim at Union Station. Gilded lilies. Better Call Saul finale tonight. Bereal getting too real. Critical Apparatus. Email Shelton. Sleepy, we’ll write later. Arrived in New York. The Gods Must Be Crazy. Had too much ramen with Clark, Angela, Alexa. Took a tour of New York walking back to Clark’s crib. Extended our stay to the 19th. Made the bad move to redownload League. Reconnected with Mr. O’Connor and played a game with Clark. Moved to the Kirtland discord. Began an omegle quest that continued deep into the night. Met some cool people in Chicago. A showcase of the rizz. 

“Hit me up if you’re in Nueva York, la gran manzana.”

Ostrakon. Perhaps, we had collected the fragments of a canopic jar. To the afterlife. The great seers and poets are in limbo anyways.
