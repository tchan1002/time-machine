Day 20  
Feeling sore, this is good. Pack for our New York trip. Watched Fight Club. The omnipresent penguin. Wild, wild twist. Arrived at the end scene with the skyscrapers. Went downstairs and washed some rice. Movies with hyperstylization. La Resurrezione. A study of trufficulture. Felt sad for a large swathe of the day. Took out the trash and took a lap around the neighborhood. Rest up and go running early tomorrow. Brushed our teeth. Restarted our alarm clock. Turn off screens in an hour. 

Requested a health center appointment  
Enter our immunization record  
Go back to our little steps  
Figure out how to operate the camera and read LLPSI

Fight club   
500 days of summer  
La la land

Movie of the summer? Her is still pretty up there. Prey was an experience. But with Taxi Driver, Fight Club, and Nightcrawler, we’re talking about the outlining of an anarchist manifesto, primal responses to the restraints of consumer capitalism.

Doctrine: On alcohol. Alcohol provides 9 calories per gram, while fat 7\. Eating a stick of butter could be fun, but why would you choose to do that?

Snippet: In any institution, the generations cycle through. Will Exeter be the same in twenty years? Like a train station, the passengers come and go. Our footprints will still be there though as millimeter indentations on the marble steps.
