II: "The editor slays our babies"
Separate our idea generation process from our culling. 

Involved interviewing. Ran over to Ida, finished coding homework. Snacked on veggie spring rolls. Ordered dumplings for tomorrow's Fire Escape event. Dot exchange: [[Amigo]] Analog. We're completely caught up on ruby now. Don't ever slack again. Great weather out. If this isn't nice, what is. Think of databases as paper. Stayed until we were the last one in our AppDev class. Redeemed ourselves with Raghu. Went to Wopo. Tired out in quite a nice way. Fourth meal with [[Thomas]]. Steely Dan's Bodhisattva. We're going to Germany. A whole week in Hamburg and Berlin. Man, that city. Was with mom there a couple years ago for IHO. Still remember walking by the Spree River, seeing the Bundestag, and coming up from the metro to see the TV tower...and hanging out at Templehoff. Felt alive there. Look at plane tickets tomorrow. We're looking up! Called Aboo. Watched Eurotrip.

Random places we've been with Mom. Pho place outside the TOEFL testing site near Framingham? One winter it was snowing hardâ€”we miss snow like that. All piled up by the side of the highway. That felt real.
