Day 46  
Listened to Phoebe Bridgers. Got dressed and went to work. *Who wants to live forever? Men endowed by their creator unalienable rights*. We kept repeating in the train station. Crescit eundo\! Sergio sent us a clip of Izzy Adesanya. Things to remember, lavender hour. Made Sergioâ€™s words our new screensaver. Paracetamol for Kary. All for the brownie points. Kary left to go volunteer at a hospital. Remembered we had free will, left work, and hiked up the Peak. Sweat bullets. Way up was steep. Cleaned up in a bathroom. Bought a bottle of red tea from a Circle K. Climbed up to the terrace. Took photos for strangers. Looked out of a telescope. *This blessed isle.* Kowloon art park looked cool. Walked by the Peak tram. Funicular railcars\! Something about nature. Found a zoo on our way down the mid-levels. Caught some ring-tailed lemurs, but our phone died. Colonial-era architecture. The Foreign Correspondents Club. Took the mtr back home from Central. Sagittarius Superstar. Pulled out our mac and read the constitution. Mind-composed as we showered. Slept.

A dowsing rod and a wishbone take the same shape.   
Reminded of our life via the indie-folk of the American northeast. 

Song: She Calls Me Back by Noah Kahan. Sagittarius Superstar by COIN.
