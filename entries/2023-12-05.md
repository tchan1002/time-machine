Triple A'd our religion papers this quarter. Move on to stats+FA. Went down to Logan to check out the editing suites. Aidan texted if we could help him walk a dog. Met Bennie and Richard. Made 20 bucks. Grabbed a bite with Rina at Bart. We will never lose as long as we have human resource. Walked back to North. Edited our HKSA photos and submitted them to Leo and Ricky. Made a @h.arr.y inspired stop-action from our Cobb cafe scrap footage of MGITKM.
