Day 13  
Called Aboo in the morning. Made breakfast, eggs on toast. A voice foretold. Chappell Roan, we are obsessed. Casey Neistat’s vlogs. Fantastic Mr. Fox (Jeremiah Johnson). Called Otis about a sliced bread feature. Set out with mom at 4:00 to go pick up Chloe. Walked down via Farmington Canal. Cold\! A 3rd generation Chevrolet Corvette. Had Kalbi-Tang at Seoul’s. Texted Clara. Picked up Chloe and got back via bus. Successfully operated on our 100d. Have to go see the milky way and northern lights. Light pollution map.

Manual for governance: Give out compliments freely. Seek out and connect with people we find cool. Expect nothing. Never be angry, always build bridges.
