**Day 28**  
Grabbed breakfast. Did laundry in the morning. Lafayette Cemetery Number 1\. Oak tree roots crack up the pavement. Paid Finn a visit at work. The Rink. Franny and Zoey, Young Mungo. Sweet humidity. Feasted at a fiery crab. Could use boiled seafood and butter any day. Slipped into a mini food coma. Get some groceries before we go tomorrow. 

Robert Lopez took no classes for law or medicine so that heâ€™d have to make a living writing musicals.
