Woke up and walked to our poli-sci lecture. Sat next to Jack Martinez. Elijah’s in the class. The Incredulity of Saint Thomas. Had breakfast at Cathey with Mock. Tomatoes and eggs. Copernican epicycles. Had lunch with Ryan and Olivia Rae. Ran into Maya. Settling into patterns. Carl Sandburg, the Wilderness. Chicago to New York. Met Sophia outside of Harper. Wandered by Saieh then walked back home. Made noodles again, three eggs. Rested. Headed out into the blue night in the direction of Ratner. Breaking the surface of water. Walked back home. Always some pair (of lovers perhaps) standing outside the reg, the end of some conversation, an unwillingness to let go. *Look out\!* Had cake while waiting for our Kung Pao Jumbo Wings. Regain our invincibility?

Illusions of grandeur or shall we rise from the grave? Resurrection, Easter.  
Jeff from Survivor is really Jeff, some sort of ultimate commitment to the bit. 

Snippet: A la Vonnegut’s Breakfast of Champions. Luminated sphere like a harvest moon rising over a blue night. Tumbleweed rolling over the flat, flat land. 

Song: All That and More (Sailboat) by Rainbow Kitten Surprise.
