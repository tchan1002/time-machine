#### Must Do's

Slept in. Ran into Vanessa on the quad as we were heading to Ulysses. Skipped class to talk. Spent the afternoon out on the quad. Finn and Claudia and Carlo. English and Irish breakfast teas with Lola and Thomas. Continued on the 9th floor. Afternoon sun. Was really nice out! Pasta night. Read Calvino's invisible cities. Sickness reorients us. Sleep so we can start the day fresh. 21 is still young, we are slouching to be born.

What are the controlables?
Sustainable improvement: sleep early, workout, read. 
Where'd all the time go todayâ€”spending time with people but also brainrot.

NYT. "Cesare Borgia arrived toting a skateboard."

Multiply the number of holes by limbs.
Indigenous bees? Hive acknowledgement.

We are the ulysses mired in modernity/ The cowboy trapped in the taxicab.
