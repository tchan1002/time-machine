Got our immigration call. Had Hot Pot with Mom and Chinatown. Not feeling the best. Was an Odyssey back. Thank god weâ€™re home. Burning moonlight. Fever, fever, fever. 

Dreamt that we were on a car ride with Steph, Harrison and Judy driving on a highway through New York. Tree branches ran through the city, our highway buttressed by them, and we were playing music.
