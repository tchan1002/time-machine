#### Must Do's
- [x] [[Asian Gangs]] Interview Guide

Involved Interviewing. Lunch. Met [[Vanessa]] at Bart. Palak Paneer and Hallowed for two seconds. BM shift. Overnight layovers turned down. Rebooked flight tickets to Germany. All the people lining up to vote at Reynolds. Felt touched seeing them show up like that. Ran into [[Jake Zucker]] on our way back to North looking for an "adventurous soul" to contribute to Maroon's Podcast department. Told him about our upcoming slot on [[WHPK]]. Flights in. Jutland. Mons Klint? Saw the afternoon sun. Napped. Met [[Jackie]] at Ida Noyes. Water polo practice. [[Lola]] helped us prep ingredients. Ground beef, shrimp, mint, cilantro, vermicelli. Vietnamese spring rolls were heavenly. Maison D-Nik.

Heligoland.

Think millions falling in the fiery pit.
