Woke up at 5:30 for senam. Morning exercise with the neighborhood. Ibu Dian and Bapak Prijo brought out tea for the crew. Much tired. Class. Two soto ayams on Fatuma. Met USINDO fellows at Sanata Dharma at 1:00. Excursion to Jiwa Jawi, then pottery village. Peanut sate was good. Susu Jahe is a flavour we should bring back—palm sugar, milk, ginger is a deadly combo. In the village, chickens run along the roads, slim but well-feathered. A white house beyond the rice paddy, a simple cube with wide rectangular windows. Strikingly modern. Brutalist? Pristine? Hung out at our kos, got a nice shower in. Pulang ke rumah'd for dinner. Bapak got us our notebook back. Take good care of it. Called mom to book plane tickets. Cleaned up our room. Set the alarm for 7 tomorrow.
