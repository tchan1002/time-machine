Picked up our laundry. Went down to woodlawn. Grabbed breakfast with Alec and Serg. A midwest Korean speech competition. Arirang. Took pictures for Angelysse. SNMS with Lola. Begging for food. Went back home. Charged our devices and collapsed. Ask Finn to hang out. Called Kary. Rehydrate. Finished the third door. 

These are an ambitious set of days.

What cripples us? This deep sense of loss that we’ve come so far for nothing. Get over that. Be Mark here. Amigo—what are we about? Making people fearless for connection. Why are we to do it? Because we win over people well.
