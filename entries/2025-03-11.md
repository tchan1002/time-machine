Woke up at 6:50 after 4 hours of sleep. Day of three finals. Managed to grab breakfast, sleep, and prepped our room for Allen's arrival. Shiloh. Are you chebbing? A psychological study. A totally consumed day. Went decently far on Moby's Flower. A minute and 30. Think grander about life now. Call our parents, call our sister, call aboo. Ridiculous smile. Shove-cake. Manus AI.

Gyuro Ramen. 

Go into business with our sister.
Be like the musk brothers.
