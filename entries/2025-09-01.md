The Aeneid is maybe a sort of latent cultural protocol. Mark followed it to facebook (imperium sine fine), and the founding fathers must have read it too. It's one we believe in, for sure.

Meta: frame negatives as positives. "spend time better" versus "don't waste time." the negative is never as instructive, it is prohibitive.
