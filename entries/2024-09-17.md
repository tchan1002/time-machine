**Day 4**  
Grossly overslept. Relented and went to training. Tori from Memoryhouse texted. Ran into Ryan Kim with his POP group. Caught up with him about his gap year, met Sal, a second year in off-off, and Pari, a new first year in DNik. Via’d from Logan to 55th street, Alex from DNik was on our ride. Mausoleum of Obama. Siam Thai closed. Ate with Musa at Thai 55 instead. Mid-autumn, the moon was full. Stopped by Trader Joe’s for mock nutella and tuscan pane. Showered. *Be like a child.*

Sam Harris from the Center of Teaching and Learning reached out to us, said someone at the Dean’s Office had put forth our name. Everyone we come in contact with is asking to hear about our summer. Get to know Luria, Markovitz RA who biked from Chicago to Wyoming, stealth camping. Do cool stuff, make waves.

Today the full force of the UChicago black community rained down on Daniel Schmidt for his twitter tweet. He dominated the news cycle of our friends’ stories. It made us think DFW was right about how easy it is to be inflammatory (cf. Host). How do we make nuanced takes viral? Don’t just let social media hijack our worst impulses.
