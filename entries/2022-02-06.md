Making a habit of waking up early on the weekends. Euphoria. Zoom with Annalisa. Shower and get cleaned up. 25 days till we catch a break in Connecticut. Went out to Sunday wopo Wei and Rosen. Did some lifting in Ransome with Franklin. Did something monumental today. Changed sheets. Look into improv at uchicago? Credible backstories. Picked up a copy of the trial of the chicago 7 from Nhan. Look into books and things we have. Voice memo. Restoring Sophocles. Watched no way home.

“Just me and you  
dancing to the tune   
of a thousand lovers   
Tonight”
