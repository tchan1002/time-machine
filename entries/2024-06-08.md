**Day 104**  
Overslept for half an hour. Come on Eileen. November to December playlist. \#Stick nation. Learn workflows. Closing time. Signed on to Luke’s project. We’re actors. Grabbed dinner with Mari. Mari, Mochi, and Lumineers. Italo Calvino’s Spiral, the universe grows to perceive itself. Car mauled by bear. Went out for a four miler. One objective for the weekend: make a hype video. Called Guang about Amigo. Wrote out our plans. Called dad until 2\.

Little nuggets of wisdom (from where we had failed) :  
Avoid paralysis of ideas—one thing at a time.  
Plan content days in advance so we don’t break streaks and get demotivated  
Get out there when we feel like it because we will lose the feeling.

The things we buy influence our behaviors.   
**Money is to be made and not saved**  
Compensate people for their time with money.  
Phantom second floor, a North pavlovian reflex.

Make office time app dev time.  
Filming takes place outside

Defining the arcs of this summer:  
Creative—filming, editing, writing  
Building—making amigo happen, coding  
Social—hanging out, meeting new people, sidequesting.
