Day 2  
New Year. Excited for our classes this quarter. Martina reached out about CNVC. Submitted our Chinatown photos for the HKSA contest. Shimmied our way into Micro. Our classes are falling into place. Hotpot for dinner. Arcade Fire on the *Her* Soundtrack. Showered. Chicago Puppet Fest on the Horizon. Go and take pictures of bison. 

Prompt: the first *camera neurologica*: images captured through brain scans show unspeakable horrors.

In the spirit of resolution, we will be relentless and unflinching in our pursuit of the openness of the world; we will engage and break bread with strangers; we will hold those we love dearly \[call aboo frequently\]; we will record, document, and crystallize.
