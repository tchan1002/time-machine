Mom’s birthday. Grabbed breakfast at Baker with Alicia. Worked on our FA homework. Met Peter and Sadiq at Harper. Submitted our FA homework. Grabbed lunch at Baker. Met Liam from Hong Kong. Alec came. Fries with sour cream. Watched the sunset out of DNik. Finished stats with Rose. Went to our super secret sliced bread meeting. A revival to the glory days. Rebranding as something punk, rebellious, even anti-establishment. All about branding.. Teeth gnashing on sliced bread. Grabbed 4th meal. Called Mom. Put ourselves on Bite magazine.
