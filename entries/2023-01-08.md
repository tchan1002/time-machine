Woke up. Carried the case box. Got hash browns and a grilled cheese from Dunkin. Iced latte via Isabelle. Olivia Rae is so goated. Submitted our theater writeup. Wrote to Fenley. Adopted a god mindset for our cross. Almost won Spamta. Defense went 4:0. Torta for dinner. Sat out on the stairs waiting for Ryan and William to get back. Got some sleep. 

Trace the craters of the moon, the soft rind of a camembert.
