Manatee Bones at 4:15. Ted writing day. Sweet dispositions. What a perfect film and movie. Scott Pilgrim. The CSO Turnover Plot. Rehearsing at 7-9 tonight at the Bowld. Finish a draft. Was not eligible to vote in the UChicago election. Brie Larson, Black Sheep. Big L missed Kiesse’s med. Remember to go to Oscair’s med next week. MASH. Back on the egg grind. Consider our history essay. Had dinner with Jacqueline and Maya in the Library basement. Gave our Ted talk. Felt good. Transcribe tonight? Probably tomorrow. Hannaford’s run. Felt good. Do laundry tomorrow. Assembly Friday. Harvard Certamen Saturday.

“And nothing ‘gainst Time’s scythe can make defense,
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.”

Song: Sweet Disposition by the Temper Traps
