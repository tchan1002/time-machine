**Day 46**  
Heard thunder and slept in. Had breakfast with Luke. Earl Gray. Skated to the reg. JaQ Lai evolution. “Quest.io”, because Luke reminded us that we have to hit o-week hard. Aryan gave us some pointers. Filled out the room lottery for Sliced Bread. Settled in front of Levi. Could hear the wind through our headphone wires. Hung out with Moran. Plans for the Minnesota State Fair? Did some pretty smooth carving on the paths. Ran into Oliver Drazky. Went back home. and cleaned up. Met Clancy at Trader Joes. Picked up some carne asada and salmon. Went to his house and fired up the grill. Graydon and Ian from the UChicago Space Program. Tomato Spanish Rice. 24 hours of lemons. Rishi told us about the writer’s residence in San Francisco. Rode in Rishi’s convertible to a lot on 61st. No trains in Trainspotting. The cinematography though. It’s an adult Ferris Bueller. Called Nick. Dreams of Portland. Caught him up with everything we’ve been on—steaks and the like.

The world is made with time and uncertainty, and some have the gift of prophecy. Think meteorologists, or Saverin in the Social Network, who made 80k off storm forecasting one summer. The premium is given to those with foresight. Financial projections to trends, it takes a visionary to see how we’ll live in 10 years.
