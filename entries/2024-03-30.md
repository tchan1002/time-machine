Woke up at 8:30. Talked business with Guang. Windy ventures founders brunch. Saturday night meal swipe with Vanessa. Took a lyft to Dawson to photograph Kate’s birthday party. Took the blue line and the 6 back after midnight. Ran into a couple skaters by Federal Plaza.

Emily Wheeler asked us what we’ve observed from human behaviour while photographing—the truth? That people can become entirely invisible. Promise ourselves we’ll be so big.
