Had breakfast with Adam and the Browning boys. Get back on the book grind. Take a look at canvas. Sat in the library for a bit. Not a particularly productive morning. Took a nap. Was windy out today. Took another fat nap. Dopamine detox. Had dinner at elm. Felt a bit uneasy but not green around the gills as Adam from the health center says. Give a go at normal human interactions. A cardboard box in our window. Oscair and Harry’s birthdays are next Tuesday. Red bikes. Went out 7 miles for our run today. Odd weekend but there’s nothing a good run can’t salvage. Ran into two people holding several silver balloons. Senior spring bucket list. Schedule a daily time to work on UTL. Francophone Society. Call aboo again. Hay day in our heyday. Willy does a wheelie. Along for the ride. Screenwriting. 

“Te tero, Roma, manu nuda, date tela, latete.”  
Nulla est enim major ad amorem invitatio quam praevenire amando.

aut quam sidera multa, cum tacet nox,  
furtivos hominum vident amores

Note: What is the central conflict? Let there be light. Garden of Eden.
