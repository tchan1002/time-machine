Day 49  
A gravity hole in the middle of the Indian Ocean. We’ve passed the 50 day mark. Read through Qiming’s internal modules. Get back to reading and R2A. Acknowledge the literature. Kary showed up around noon. Had 譚仔三哥 again. Stopped for some ice cream. Got the waffle kind. Uninstalled Reddit and Instagram. Cormac McCarthy. Watched 中國合伙人. Got emotional. Took the Tung Chung express to Nam Cheong. Handed meals out to the homeless. Had dinner at Hashi. Tired. Plans for Barbie postponed to tomorrow. 

The Black Hawk War. 

Snippet: Blood meridian. A fascination with the west. The apache and us, the first and last inhabitants of this continent. Across the Bering strait. The same eyes, wrinkle, worn, sunburnt—we saw in a photograph, Prophet Neolin, master of life.
