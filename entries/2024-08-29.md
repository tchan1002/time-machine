**Day 24**  
Ran into Bianca Lee on our way to Georgetown. Kei Sakano showed us a coffee shop. He’s flying out to Kazakhstan tonight. Stopped by Trader Joes for green tea mochis and dumplings. Watched a little bit of Pearl, then John Oliver. Xorp the Alien baby. Bid Maya farewell. Storm brewing outside. Called Mom. Apple pie at Whole Foods. Pigeons in the train station. An hour delay. Aboard the Northeast Regional. Not really sleeping—passed Philly, Metuchen, Newark. Penn station at three in the morning. Train emptied out. Stopped two hours in the city. 

NYT Op-docs: Sean Wang’s H.A.G.S.  
Go to zingers.  
When did we become UChicago’s RNC rep.

*Box of Rain* from *The Importance of Being Iceland* was a “travel” article that irked us severely. Just weird to make sleeping on the streets aesthetic.

The Eastern trains are much less spacious. 

Going back home to shower and get some good sleep for a couple days. Work on sliced bread stuff. Articles on social media, what we’ve learned. Work on an app if we can. Call Kermath, Grace, Gretl. Cut our hair—we’re looking a little homeless.
