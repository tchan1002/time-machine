Last day at our lab. Felt somber. Talked with Diego. Dinner at Colin's. Amber. Took Lime scooters back to North. Sleep. Pushup failure.

Oliver Interview secured for Monday.
Prep so that the questions are insightful. Look at Diego Scanlon.

Went up to Colin's for Windy Build dinner.
Look good and set the record straight.
Fluff up the front of our hair so it doesn't just drop down.
