Woke up to the Backseat Lovers. Made our sliced bread poster in the A level. Molenilo font. Ordered 75 dollar worth of buns from Chiu Kwon for pickup on Thursday. Sakir Khadir’s photos of men and children in Palestine. Read on suffering and the Buddha. Had Hainanese chicken rice from Hutch. Protests on the quad. Coffee and the Chairs. Moved to the Harper cubicles. Went to our first Firebird meeting. Poach talent. Met Claire who does Photography. Grabbed a bite at Baker with Olivia Rae. Encounters with the Jeff Lind. Worked at Hutch. Co-editors in Chief. Grabbed fourth meal with Josie and Clancy. Showed Clancy our room. Do a fire escape with Clancy. 

Snippet: We’re going to be evangelists. Get people to sign on. Spread the good word. Treat it like our baby. Dog-gone hunger. Produce, produce, produce. The money shot. Undergrad, underground, understaffed.

*Puniceus purpureus*, the big purple eater  
The great interconnectivity of things should shock you.   
Song: Out of Tune by the Backseat Lovers.
