Religion. No circles, no change. Gustavo Gutierrez. Started reading the third door. Look into Dim Order. Tim Lee and Ben Wong. A24 contact with Haley. Blunderbuss. Went to American Cities. Galena and lead. Museum towns. The range of the buffalo. Call mom, call dad, call aboo. Julian, the Rapoports, driven out of Italy into Eastern Europe. Julia Ernst, we’re not really strangers. Booked an appointment with counseling. Fight this sleep thing, we need more productive hours. Music map. Caught Lara in Woodlawn. Went to Ida—our first contacts in publishing. Sent our first cold email to Julia Ernst. Hit 80 pushups. Today was a good day.

The earliest American cities took root as articulation points of conquest. The English in the Northeast, the French to Mississippi, and the Spanish all along the Gulf of Mexico. Built their cities on Indian towns, drove the Indians out. So find old maps with *Louisiana* scrawled over swathes of Illinois. 

Borrowed credibility: Chicago Maroon.   
We’re not so far from where we have to be.   
Entrepreneurial attributes: we are creative, persuasive, we politick for solutions, we can plan and manage. We are patient with people.   
Non-entrepreneurial attributes: non-persistence, inconsistent carry through, mood swings.  
How to fix? Rid ourselves of our poverty mindset—money is to be made, not saved.
