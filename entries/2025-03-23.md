Nassim Taleb. Lunch at Cathey. Ate with Eitan. Diego Scanlon and Kimani. Went uptown near Western. Sat in a coffee shop and worked. Foggy, rainy out. Descript audio editing on our (P)rind episode. Holden and the Renaissance. Stopped by Village Discount. Picked up a shirt and two pairs of jeans. Holden gave us a placard of St. Francis. "Gnaw on thy flesh". RA meeting. Worked into the night.

We escape the party. The car drives south, it does not stop. No mind the crowd. We plunge into the lavender sea. We do not sink. A bubble floats into the sky in front of us, then two and three. Now everywhere around us, bubbles rising, ascending, under the fullness of the sunset. Tamie Okase.
