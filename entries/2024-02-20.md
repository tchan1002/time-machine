Grabbed a small breakfast with Lola before Shantideva. Weather was nice and we sat outside for a little bit. Went to micro. Drafted our Sliced Bread letter from editors. Had a really nice lunch with Peter out on the quad. *If only we were a more competitive rat*. Went to Firebird. Walked back to North with Joyce. Had a baker dinner.
