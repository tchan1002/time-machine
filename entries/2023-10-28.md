Spent the day on our Stats homework. Did laundry. Grabbed fourth meal with Henry Josephson. Went to Nando’s with Ryan. Per peri chicken liver. Dropped by Hyde Park Records. Battlefield band. Went down to Ginny and Veronica’s. 36 questions with Noah. The perks of being a wallflower. Big thief karaoke circle. Dropped by the OLAS party. Came back with our residents. Listened to Vanessa play the piano. Slept at 3:00

Set a man at variance with his father, and divide brothers from brothers.
