Day 43  
Bananas and hard boiled eggs for breakfast. Not feeling the best. Migraine continuing. Dissociated. Met up with Russell for lunch. Had some ramen at the Japanese place opposite Tamjai Samgor. 三人行，必有我師焉. Sent Russell off. Changed and went to Sunshine Action. Had dinner with Brooke and Angie. Failed an escape room at Causeway Bay. Talked to Brooke as we walked her back. Missed our stop repeatedly. Cling onto life. Took the bus home. 

Snippet: Caught a little whiff of a story, and took on everything. Grenouille in Das Perfume. A need for narrative, for definition despite the arbitrariness of signs. 

Snippet: A fascination with the Pandoran Biosphere. To re-envision our interconnectedness as a neural network. Social dependence as a biological necessity. Cities are superorganisms.
