Woke up to a cool fog. Review for math before today and tomorrow. Finished Slaughterhouse Five. *Traversed the moon-like ruins of Dresden.* Pareto optimality—a no-sum game. Had breakfast with Ben, Jack and Emily. Had exoplanets with Tae. Read the Gospel of John. Galilee and Gallifrey. Lunch with Audrey, Asa and Meklet. No predator, think we’re prey. Settled in the Stuart Cubicles. Ran into Judy. Heaven sent, Doctor Who. John Donne to Yeats. Spend tomorrow reviewing for math. Spoke to Grace Brown about survivor plans. Ate at Baker with Bill Baker and people. Berealed. Played Chess with Adrien. Nat out at Tribal. Micro-scav. Visited Eric’s place. Ran odd errands with Eric. Wore seven jackets from Crown to Woodlawn. Returned at 1:00 after various ventures on the quad. 

When he hath tried me   
I shall come forth as gold—Job

Snippet: John Donne’s Devotions upon Emergent Occasions\! How in days of sickness last winter we thought of mortality. Little sleep roused the soul to appreciate good health. The hallucinations\!—imagined that our body was a precarious vehicle with a need for balance. As if some space ship suspended upon our sheets. 

Memento: Stay unproblematic.
