Fundamentals interviews. Meeting with Professor Meredith this afternoon. Had breakfast with Cyrus. Fucked up our schedule, missed class. Called Corinne. Limbo-esque day. Think we feel pretty destroyed from our visit home. The masque of red death. Grabbed dinner. Wake up early tomorrow and do our work. Get our three As and get out of here. Go to Harper first thing in the morning tomorrow. 

Come on, get up. Come on.  
*Tis nobler of the mind.*

List of people we think are cool: Will Park, Elijah Jenkins, Kevin Treehan, Emily Wheeler, Colin Yuan
