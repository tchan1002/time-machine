Lock in. Grabbed our first bite of the day at 3:00. Huddy. Honey toast goat. Scheduled our interview with Randy. Say we talked to Aaron and Zara. Man, we're exhausted. Had some of Joe’s cheesecake. Watch a man cut fish.

We’ve just got to be hungrier than anyone else.  
Spring passed so silently and we’ve said little.   
Cyanotype t-shirts.
