Hopped on a bus to the consulting symposium. Sears tower. Caffeine chocolates. Is this what we want to be doing? Caught up with Serg on the bus ride back. *Tikkun olam* with a sci-fi imagination. Two summers had entirely radicalized us—something about the soul must be saved. Roshaan. Claudia and Finn, Baker, Dinner. Garfield green line. Called Aboo on the L, showed her a view of the city. *Say hi to granny.* The rich hate noise\! Urban sounds. Momotaro—took pictures for Alyssa’s birthday. David, our neighbor, showed up. Was actually so nice this time. Trampoline parks. We’re in the green. 

*The horror of the cyborg is a visual image of the degree to which technology has intruded upon our lives. A fear manifested so viscerally in the mending of steel and flesh.*
