Showered in the morning. Ek twn bibliwn. Went to printmaking. Read stardust and carved our ex libris. Had breakfast with Mikey. To catch a falling star. The next Homer. 6524 doesnâ€™t seem to work. Ordered Exonian merch. The last day of April. Learn Morse code. Took a fat nap. Perform our daily maintenance. Musas mihi memora. The death of English would be a shame to the memory of the bard. Entropy perhaps. Linguistic genocide. The Dragons of Eden. Dangal. Sat in the library for a decent bit. Did linguistic turnovers. Moved to grill. Played Quad Ball. Sat with Holden in his room. Golden Slumbers. Went to set up for Soul Fest. Holden the Soul Fest MVP Called Aboo. Felt a bit weird at the end of the night. Went to bed early.
