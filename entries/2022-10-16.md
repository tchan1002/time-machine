Had 奶黃包 for breakfast. Taking today off. Get our homework done and get rested for school this week. Canceled today’s meetings. Make-new conspiracy? Walked to Woodlawn. Think we’ll stay here until dinner. Woodlawn marathon. Write our essays. Legend of the Kirtlandi. Mints outside of ihouse. Napped and showered. Squid game is now a reality show? Attended house council. Finish draft and submit. Got a rice bowl down at Tiffins. Called Arhon. Sophia. Antonio Fava. Watched some comedia. God, so excited for when we’re not sick. Weekend’s been fantastic. House Targaryen. Submitted our draft at 2\.
