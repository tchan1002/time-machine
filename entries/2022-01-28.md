Up and at em. Breakfast. Semiotics. Schools of Thought. Met with Terhune. Visited Molina. Let’s get this thing solved. Auditing 430? Melmoth the Wanderer. I’ll take those who know what beauty is, and those who know what sorrow is. Prep for president. Snow storm coming tomorrow. Weekend to rest up. Draft email to Mr. Wilson. Yeezus. Bound 2\. Exeter Math Competition. Thompson’s Folklore Motif Index. The Monologues in Shameless. Jody is a chad. Looked for an archaeopteryx. Stay hard.

Oscar, you shouldn't have shown them such kindness.   
The world was never meant for one as beautiful as you. 

From your grave,  
“And alien tears will fill for him  
Pity's long-broken urn,  
For his mourners will be outcast men,  
And outcasts always mourn.”
