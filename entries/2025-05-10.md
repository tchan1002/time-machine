#### Must Do's

Morning. Had our ID replaced. Clark in town. Lunch at bartlett. Sat by the duck pond with Ryan and Penelope. Moved to the Reg for a mango lassi. Make a play for Indo. Nice day out. Shut eyes make for fiery tardigrades. Boat jacuzzis. Constant generation of ideas. Met Clark outside of the Chinatown library. Talked music, robert lopez, pope class. Tried mochis. Took the train back. Ran into Chong on the platform. Hitched a lyft ride with Alan from Thompson. Clean house.

Fine cloths and scents and lavish banquets.
He hath tried me and I shall come forth as gold.

Reg A level. Been a while since we've been down here. Four concrete walls hem in a grass courtyard, ready for some Mayan game. 

Can we write a story that covers half an hour. A man goes down the length of the L to sell his wares. Compartment by compartment.
