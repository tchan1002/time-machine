Morning. Blanketed in snow as we left Involved Interviewing. Ran into [[Guangxinyang]] at Ida. Headed over to Woodlawn. Had a snowball fight with Yousef, who said it was his first time seeing snow. Maroon meeting. Hot cocoa and aged dutch cheese. Callback to [the Holders series](https://the-holders-series.fandom.com/wiki/The_Holders_List). Talked with [[Alec]] about the three sisters and thanksgiving plans. Stopped by Jewel-Osco for tide pods. Promotion to head arts editor, we're playing with the big boys now. Made dumplings. Tori came by. Trial and error, tossed some fried dumplings in kimchi sauce. Walked [[Tori]] back to Max P. Looked up at the sky and it was as if we were looking at a shore.

Take care of our things, take care of ourselves.

The feeling of experiencing something for the first time is infectious, re: snowball fight with [[Youssef]]. We get a new appreciation for what we're used to when we see it through someone else's eyes. 

A CONCEPTION OF THE SELF RELIES ON PERCEPTION BY THE OTHER.
