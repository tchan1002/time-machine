Day 11  
Shaved and freshened up. Lara picked us up. Big tepee on our drive to Guilford. Walked around the beach. Wilfred Armster’s spaceship. Dropped by Big Y for some chicken and jalapeno poppers. Ate in the car. Went to Lara’s house, then she drove us back. Dinner with dumplings—what a nice family dinner with Lara there. The tea was delicious. God tier hangout with Lara today. Evil Morty Theme (Orchestral Version) to round out this year. *Eternal Sunshine.* Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Check skiwear when we pack. 

I have a feeling that you will be very important to me*.*  
Remind this heart of the passion that tears hath fed.

Snippet: The condominium complex resembled a spaceship. A lead plated oval suspended by concrete beams, it was the brainchild of one Wilfred Armster. When asked by the locals why he didn’t design something more natural and colonial, he replied “what do you think the Natives thought of the settler’s homes?”
