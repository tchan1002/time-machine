Oreo breakfast. Do our stats homework. Goodwill. Drifting into microsleep. Had water with Claire. Pablo Escobar. Spoke to Katie about Fundamentals. Went out to midnight soccer with Kireeti and Geronimo. Have to try a good burrata. Zeneliâ€™s. 

In the valley of the dog.   
*Sorry that my hands smell like lobster.*

Sliced bread: make an artist feature presentation.
