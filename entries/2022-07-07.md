Day 75  
Toast for breakfast. Keep the water cycle going. Celery sprouting leaves. Meeting with Smaiyl tomorrow at 1:30. Get back up there. Bojo down. La Demi mondaine. La Belle Epoch not so belle. Henri Rousseau. 16 days till Boston. Cook some ground meat. The destruction of the Georgia Guidestones. Dendrochronology. Neolithic developments. Anthology. The everlasting soul. Ran through our Latin and Parts 1 and 2 Math placement. Prepare for Greek beforehand. Sort of feeling down today. May have slightly oversalted our beef. Iodized salt. Fleur de sel. Shred cabbage into ground beef tomorrow. Succumbed, see if we can find some friends on tinder.

Get mom involved. Start on Wechat and develop a script. Parent group chats. “家长你好”
