Day 17  
Shaved. A new man\! Look for nice sweaters. Life of the mind. Calvino’s amorous birds of prey. Consider photography. Read Bluets by Maggie Nelson, a blue-fueled fanaticism. Blue, like love, is a god. Colour as a platonic form. Talk to Clark about it. *Noli me tangere—for doubt me not*. Arthur Sze. Uchi winter survival guide. Start vlogging. Go visit Career Advancement. Exeter grads are everywhere. Went out for a mile. Thoughts on a streetlamp. Compose tomorrow. Going to Costco tomorrow. 

To His Coy Mistress by Andrew Marvell 

Dreamt that we ran into Jacqueline at Weth. She thought we’d hate to see her. Went through the doors and walked out to a lilypond in summer. The air was yellow, the hue of sunlight and nostalgia.

Snippet: At dusk, the cold warmth of the streetlight on the asphalt is the colour of surrender. *There are things we can’t change,* we say as our breath crystallizes into cigarette smoke. In the moment between one fucked thing and another, man is infinite—we are awake.
