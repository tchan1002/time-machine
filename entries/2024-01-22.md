Showered in the morning. Too many things to do. Vagrant mother. We’re Gatsby. Dragged the PA speaker from Hallowed to Stuart. Abigail helped us out. Grabbed lunch at Bart. Think we’re just going to stay in today. Inuit sunglasses. Slept for a good couple hours. Got some food at Baker with Raquel, Corinne and Ellie. Found our earphones in our vest pocket. Made some pasta. Get a good block of Cheddar. Sufjan Steven Illinois Musical? Listened to Carrie and Lowell. Become one of those long haired flagellants.
