Went for a morning swim. Grabbed brunch at Roux with Rodrigo, Leyla, Minseo and Enzo. Found ourselves in Harper. Caught up with Noah. Think of something to do through Polsky. Boiled milk. Sleep meditated. Read the Bodhicaryavatara. Went out for a midnight run. 

Just a week until Mexico.

Have to believe that the day can always be saved.  
Water, get off our bed, open the window, stop drifting.   
Cow of plenty.
