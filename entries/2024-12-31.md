Had Casa da India leftovers for breakfast. Cold octopus. Spent a minute just sitting in the sunroom, feeling the morning come in through the window. Lisbon lounge. Bacalhau croquettes. Madrid. Wandered. Finished the Road. 8 books this year. Updated our goodreads account. Reading is probably our best bet at fighting fragmentation—it's a habit of consistency. Hope it'll roll over to writing. NYE.

One last transmission from 2024.

Summer on the bus. Clancy: it's bad when it's clear that the author is lying, it's worse when it's clear they're lying to themselves/ real naive question, how do we deal with all that overwhelming suffering everywhere in the world/ think party at evgenia's with noah lee and leo. our talk of idealism and pragmatism/ heuristic: *this matters* or *this doesn't matter*/ all we can do now is fight fragmentation/ thank god for having visited the city of san francisco.
