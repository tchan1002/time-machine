Woke up at around 11:00. Stopped by the Windy Ventures brunch. Met [[Shikar]], talked about solar. He said a friend who made his money off construction taught him everything about perfumes. Sat with [[Isabella]] and [[Leena]] for a bit. Intro'd [[Nikhil]] to [[Obsidian]]. Walked with [[Jasper]] to [[The Point]]. On the way, a cannibalized bike and a desiccated Elmo atop a car’s sunroof. Went to the point. Vegan hotdogs. Made smores. Went in the water. Dropped by Trader Joe's after. Met with [[Joe]] and [[Cristi]]. Building manager night shift. Read [[Amitav Ghosh]]. Does take us 2 hours to read 40 pages. The [[Geniza]], the storehouse of knowledge. Stayed up late late. Gorged on the toasted bread and the triple cream cambonzola we got at Trader Joe's.

How odd really that our name is Toby, not something like Alex or Ben?

Sonnet 12, [[Shakespeare]].
> And nothing ‘gainst Time’s scythe can make defence  
   Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.

Really we want to harness information to make better decisions about our life. Remember to do things that make us smile! That's being with other people (meaningfully), travelling, working on something exciting.
