Day 16  
Two days till New York. Tempus fugit. Naruto. Made Whampoa Eggs for lunch. George Ezra. Baked our clay. Correction: Overbaked. Ekphrastic literature. Went down to Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Had dinner at a Japanese restaurant and rain started pouring. Until I Found You played as we left. We seem to be missing a certain Studio Ghibli fan a little extra. Καταδεσμοι, curse tablets. Looked up an area code map of the US. Japanese woodblock prints. Took another google maps tour of Chicago. Wake up early, wash the dishes, and pack.

Snippet: To think that you’d fall in love again, that another will make you laugh and feel your soft cheeks. Under the vibrating Dairy Queen sign, only the blizzard exists. The curb, the grass, it’s all gone to shit. 

Dreamt that Exeter was an airport with moving walkways and a surprising number of swimming pools. Took a small religion elective and met 2026ers.  

Meta: Reviewed our last days of Exeter on this log. Summer turned out differently but we’ve definitely grown. 

Song: Build Me Up Buttercup by the Foundations. Hooked on a Feeling by Blue Swede.
