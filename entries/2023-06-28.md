Day 72  
Traveled to Tiu Keng Ling to donate fortune bags to the Yon Oi Tong kindergarten. Spoke with the principal. Hong Kongâ€™s low birthrate observed through decreased enrollment. A pandemic bottleneck, the middle class leaving in droves. Had char siu and chicken rice. Exercised our free will as we exited the mtr stop. Did not head home but wandered around instead. Stopped by the playground and did some pushups. Started drafting a coolcat that we finished at the library. Days escaping us. Commit to breathing. Weather so nice as we exited the library. Lion Rock in the distance. Rain must have cooled things down. 

Snippet: Watched the Arnold biopic a couple weeks ago. Arnold said that his one gift was an extraordinary ability to visualize. *If I can see it, I can achieve it,* he said. I thought that was profound.
