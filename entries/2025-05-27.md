Straight wake at 6. called aboo briefly. Packed all of our stuff. Work. Grab breakfast. We're 5 pages done. Go sleep for an hour. Went by Vue 53 to drop off our things with Aiden Tandiono. Bought a card for Joe and Cristi, scribed it in our room. Left for O'hare. Rough ride as we hammered down our Marx Paper. Typing on our phone at the O'hare line. At least we're done and at the airport. Leave it behind us. Truly limbic spaces. Done with Paperino 2. We're good for now.

Dreamt that we were poolside california, underneath the alcove of a restaurant. It's cavernous walls, caving in like a Gaudi. Popcorn ceilings. Someone the table over asked what we would hate to lose most and we said our naïveté. 

If gravity is the zip file compressing. Melvin Vopson.
