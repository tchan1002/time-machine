Day 83  
Dreamt about figuring out English electives with Harry (Gorman) and Jacqueline. Downloaded our course and advisor comments. Wagon Wheel. Saved our Exeter emails on gmail and set up automatic replies. Set up rock and venmo. Taxi driver. Suicide as a Sort of Present by David Foster Wallace. Scythe by Neal Shusterman. Dumplings again. Taxi Driver, a 70s Western. Inspect documents for our driving lesson. Some printer difficulties. Le Panache. Changed our ticket to the 23rd. Get back up there. It’s morbin time. Called Allen and Vincent. Made fries. Need to intake more calcium. Massive cleanup and groceries tomorrow. Have to get back to living well if we’re going to stay here till the 23rd. These entries have been too short for staying inside all day. Sat outside for a bit. Why does this man know how to fly? A cool cat post is much needed. Reach out to other people so we can stay alive.
