Washed up. Had a bit of breakfast at Weth. Sent out the necessary emails. Lots of time available today. Make the most of it. Day’s tremendous. Spent a little time in Grill. Watched You with Shalom and Allison at Weth. ISA Meeting at 6\. No ISA meeting at 6\. Took a nap. Stayed at Grill for an eternity this afternoon with Jacqueline and Clark. Esso chess. Abducted by ESSO chess. Picked up some food at elm. Ran into Amber and Claire. Went penny boarding with them and Arhon. Had pizza instead. Racing into the night. Had a mad time at Certamen practice. Went out for a short run. Did a couple pull ups on the tree. Ran into Adam on the way back. Think we grind out Electric Sheep and There There before Tommy Orange gets here on Friday. Cool night. Triple sleep in. Senior Bookmark. Visit the library tomorrow. Alright we got the Ted talk. Work on it now.
