Woke up and felt much better. Grabbed brunch. Met with Tori from memoryhouse. Sat in on an editors meeting. Plans to co host an open-mic third week. FESAP didn’t make it through. Wrote to Stephen and Haydt. Have to keep people in mind\! Cristi’s a big fan of Freud. Had some terrific lamb for dinner. Mochi’s at the house meeting.
