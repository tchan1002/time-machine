Slept in. Submitted our gradescope. Took today off. Had lunch at Woodlawn with Jack Archer. Borrowed a charging cord from the reg. Went to Target for a charger. Ran into Mateo. Sat down with Judy in the reg. Read Agamemnon. Keep our heads up. Met with Jesenia at 4:30 at Cobb. Spooky talking doors. Went to Cathey for dinner. Mock merch. Went to bed.

Gained a recent understanding of Mr. Brightside,  
But let shadows not be cast upon our W weekend.  
Song: All These Things That Iâ€™ve Done by The Killers.
