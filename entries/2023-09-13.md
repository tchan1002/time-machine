Ran into Moreau passing through social science in the morning. Gary, Indiana day trip? Document the rust belt. Title IX. Had lunch with Claire. Reservation dogs. Logistics meeting in the evening. Move in is going to be a beast. Skeleton crews. Thompson 5th floor lounge, Cymbal monkey on the binding of a beat up Stephen King novel. *Floaters can be runners, runners find stuff.* Had thai with Joe, Cristi and Annie in their apartment. Slept.

Snippet: “Orientation is information through a firehose” Housing, this behemoth. 100 people in our house. 800 in the building. A resident above anything.
