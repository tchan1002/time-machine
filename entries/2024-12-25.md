#### Must Do's
- [x] Finish Crying of Lot 49.
- [x] Text Ava we visited Kornerpark

Showered in the morning. Packed our things for Lisbon. Finished the Crying of Lot 49. Flushing, Congee Village. Met a priest at JFK. Hung out in the sensory room. Started David Graber's Debt.

The religious economic life. 
Our financial ties are social ties. 
We must train ourselves to reject retrograde protoworlds.
