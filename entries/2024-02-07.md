Grabbed breakfast. Got our website back up. Joseph Gordon Levitt. Banh Mi with Eliana. Had a sweet matcha latte from Grounds of Being. Took the north bus to go see a stage adaptation Sufjan Steven’s Illinois. The cast came out as we were waiting for the bus back—went up to them and thanked them for the most touching piece of art that we’ve come to witness in our twenty years of life.

Song: Alaska by Maggie Rogers.
