Keraton visit in the morning. Javanese has an o-shift. Budoyo is budaya. Goa is gua. Asked the *abdi dalem* who toured us what drew them to serve the Sultan for life. They answered with a Javanese phraseâ€”swaranang jantung (the sound of the heartbeat). Lunch at Parot Siramam, Leila's rec. A mini art exhibition on the walls. Had some good Khao Soi, go back if our Pho cravings resurface. The USINDO fellows' visas might be expiring at the end of the week. Went back home and slept. Plaza ambarrukmo. Coolcatted. Had udon at uragame with Trisha, Amber and Aurora. Jakarta prices. Bought ourselves a rochetted sunflower, and a pressed flower keychain for aboo.

Do our own thing.
Golden boy. Dream man.
