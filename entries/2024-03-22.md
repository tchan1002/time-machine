Zoomed Sunny and Monica. Showered. Grabbed breakfast with Moran. Teabag in honey water. Snowfall. Sat in Harper Cafe for a bit. Grabbed dinner at Woodlawn. Went to watch Fight Club. Felt a little down when we returned home. Called Lara and Maya. 

See the world change and perhaps the stars do make their return.
