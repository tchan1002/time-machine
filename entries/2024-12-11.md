Baker, we grinded out. Met with Johanna for Schwarz. Had lunch with [[Colin Yuan]] at Ascionne Bistro, who treated us to mussels and truffle fries. Talked Murakami. Went back to baker. Grinded out and handed in our English Finalâ€”on time. [[Jelani]] showed us his poems that he wrote for astro. Ask for *Hey Leo* (two brothers and relativity)
