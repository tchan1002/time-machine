Theater 24\. Was an experience to see Lincoln at work. The dissection of a script. Ran into Oia on our lunch break. Rehearsed, rehearsed, rehearsed, then performed. Warmed up in a circle. This collective thing. Pass the Squeeze. The lights were blinding—we gave our monologue. Crowd was awesome. Out on the parapet with Josiah and Ethan. The moon and Saieh. What a high\! With Guido on the couch. Exhausted. Walked back to North, showered and slept. The past 48 hours have been so long in the best way.

Clancy told us that we’d show up in the morning, see the script and think this is going to be terrible, but it’s all going to come together. That’s exactly what happened. 

We by Yevgeny Zamyatin.   
The moon as a monstrous eye.
