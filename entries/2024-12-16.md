Day 1 of trek. Coming down with a real cough. Women don't drive in Georgia. Technical University Hamburg. The roadside reeds oft overgrown. School food. Visited Microharvest, an alt-protein startup growing microbes in bio-reactors.  Finished the day's visits. Went out to the Christmas markets with the group. Had perhaps the best hotdog we've ever had from one of the stalls. Just the right amount of springiness. Nick. Doner #3. Went into the Rathaus. Had a nice strawberry tea at Parliament with Caden, Bi, and Ray. Walked back to the hotel.
