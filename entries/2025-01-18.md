Michigander debut album prerelease (via Maroon). Went through SNO analytics, our stories have an average of a couple hundred views. Arrived at MADD round 10. Sophie Wingland told us to look into Career Advancement, and that she's leaving to go to grad school. Met Isabella. Pitched a Rashomon text game adaptation where you play through all the characters. Andy Weir's the egg. We conduct all violence unto ourselves. Went to shoot for MODA, took pics of the designers. Honest fire. Gamejammed for four hours. Fish school, baseball. On duty tonight. Knock out stuff. Put up 40 pushups. 100. Stress the organism. Sony Creator 2MB import > Photos > iPad is a dastardly combo.

Michigander's one to watch.
Dropped in on our radar with East Chicago, IN.

"I am excited to share that we are a no good degenerate!"

[[Webapp Ideas]]: [[Rashomon the Game]]
Rashomon text game adaptation. Inspo: Andy Weir's the egg. The choices you make as one character run downstream as you play through samurai, wife, bandit, woodcutter, commoner, priest. (Critique of the CYOA form)

e.g if samurai and wife never encounters the bandit, they live happily ever after, but then the woodcutter never steals the sword to be able to buy food for his family, and the woodcutterâ€™s family starves
