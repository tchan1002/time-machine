Got the Sunshine Action internship\! Called Mom and Dad. Could be a cool summer. Return to activity. Applied to Trott. Feeling productive. Godland next Saturday at DocFilms. Finished our apes. Went swimming. Ate with Sophia at Baker. Two plates of Kosher rice, beef and beans. Walked back to ihouse via 56th. Called JF. Write our apes papers ahead of time. A day saved.

Snippet: “To not need a kingdom is in itself a massive kingdom.” Seneca, Thyestes. How willing are you to take on arbitrary systems of thought, to mark yourself as a man of the cloth? Found ourselves desiring some flagellation for our god. *Come unto me*, as Jesus said.
