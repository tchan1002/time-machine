Dropped Mercer and Ammar off at Reynolds. Went to our polisci discussion. Dropped Macro. Lockean provisos and mushroom picking. Had a multiplate brunch at Cathey. Walked back and had a multi hour nap. Arms seem decently recovered. R2A; save this day. Limbo-esque. Called Aboo. A month and a half left of school? Tempus fugit. Watch Solar Opposites. Changed our spotify plan. Got Showtime. Chupa. Honey and walnuts. Going to Devinâ€™s tomorrow for Easter.

Are we romancing? Are we dancing?  
Drink only water. Abstain from dairy and sugar. Eat meals and not snacks.
