Got dressed. Hat season. Walked to Bart. Plato’s Definitions. Replied to Ms. Gruneisen about our CEW train tickets. The Wieboldt prints. Went to office hours. Composed our close reading. Ran to mock. Had late dinner with Jesenia, Isaiah, and Riley. Took a lyft back. Repaid our debt to Sophia. Stayed up until three in the Breck common room with Gabby. Apocalypse by Cigarettes after Sex.
