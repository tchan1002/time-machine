Day 27  
Slept in. Sore throat. Didn’t go to work. Gave ourselves a little rest. Slept for most of the day. Body pains. Remember the life that we have and are returning to. Showered with hot water. Hadn’t done that in a while. Felt nice. Prereg over, at least we got religion. Celebrate a birthday together with Aboo. 

Maybe we start winning  
Rest up, look good, get ready for Chicago.
