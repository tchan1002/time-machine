Woke up at 7:00. Walked to Ratner in the rain. Swam. Choked on a little water. Tasha at the health center. Rest and relax. Visited the Ekhart library. Took headshot for and submitted our O-Team application. Be the Heckler. Match against Keller this Sunday. Had lunch with Fredric. Gravity falls theme. Settled again in our cubicle. Do our work. Reconnected with Maile on LinkedIn. Ideas for Thyestes, will they come to fruition? Met Bill down at Tiffins. Titus was Born. Had Tofu stew. Plotted out Thyestes. Recorded Atreus’ lines. Watched You with Sophia and Erin. Retrieved a cardboard box from recycling. Made three heads. Borrowed tape from Sophia. *We’re fumbling*. Stopped by House geoguessr. 

*Candida tibi soles, Toby.*   
Memento: Always reach out. Always communicate. Remember no social cost.
