The body and the blood of the genuine Christine. Woke up and phoned in to a SITG meeting. Momentarily frightened by the thought of being completely alone in Jakarta this summer. Drifted into microsleep during our Ulysses class. Our eyes held shut because the flowers won't stop kissing us. Napped for a good 2 hours. Mandatory day off for [[Papam]]. Circa 6pm, typed up our essay for Character and Commerce. Wrote it quickly and just sent it in. White flat roofs outside the bathroom window. Went out for a run along the point. Mucus-filled. Cleared it out of our lungs. Read Mishima's Golden Temple on our walk back home. Three plates of salad with ranch. Did our laundry. Clean slate.

JJ from Syncorp. And of course the issue with his neighbor hacking his lungs out through the wall.

Outstretched hand, palmer grasp reflex. Phantom cusp

Thoughts on Mishima. Black and white under the moon. So stark in our mindâ€”the description of a temple's woodwork as displaying a sort of skeleton?! Wish we could somehow paint that scene of Uiko and her parents out in the field. Haven't read a description so clear and easily visualized in a while. Last time might have been Neil Gaiman's Stardust.
