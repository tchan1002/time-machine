Day 59   
Woke up. Something hit us on the train to work. Cried among strangers. Drafted a coolcat. Went out to lunch with Kary. Had a char siu rice. Sad boi hours. The Landmark overpass though. A view down Queenâ€™s Road Central. Taught Kary to say *opp*. Another to comment on our resemblance to a macaroni penguin. Changed in the bathroom before heading over to Sunshine Action. Living a double life. Worked on the OSC proposal. Took the mtr back home. Did pushups. We asked to be reborn. 

*Harness Human Power.* 

Coolcat: Hand looped around a straphanger, saw both our father and mother for the first time in a window turned black mirror. A lesson on epigenetics from Chisholm, hunger lasts for generations after a famine. Felt so tangibly the imprint of one life on another. Shame to not have felt it before.
