It’s Friday the 13th. Made sliced bread a three headed beast. Designed workflows during our FA class. Systems sciences. Submissions are our **lifeblood.** Grabbed lunch at Bartlett. Talked briefly with Oia. So many plans. Sent out emails for Sliced Bread. Applied for the Associate Arts Editor position at the Maroon.  Sat with Corinne and Raymond. Grabbed dinner at Bart with Josie. Hedgehog in the Fog. Saw Occam’s Razor at the FXK. Running gags. Walked back to North. Rested before going out to play soccer with Thomas and Aravil. In the rain and the mud, we became animals. Forgot how good this feels. Jim Thorpe.

Memento: Some people will have the nice homes and the nice things, and that will not be you. But you will be given something far greater, and that is dominion over yourself.
