Math test. Revisited the academy basement. Finished Greek Test. Things lost to Mildew, Mice, Moths and Men. Phormio on a tablet. Do Laundry. Dhall Crackers and Sardines. Read some of the Old Man and the Sea. Talked to Rishi about classics. CCC review. Sat with Tommy and Daniel in Grill. Literature and the Sea. Had a good long talk with Will. The last midnight scream. Get ready for spring term. Do laundry tomorrow. Inherent aesthetic value. Legal positivism. In the cold dark depths of Chicagoland. Bring some books back. Pack lightly into a bag. Wake up early tomorrow. Have the oranges. Scan check tomorrow. Called Mikey. Prepared bags for tomorrow.

“There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too.” Old Man and the Sea.
