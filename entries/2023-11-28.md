Sat and talked with Connelly at breakfast. Settled in a Harper cubicle to grind out work  Civil religion in Americaâ€”a national faith. Got our Calvino class for the winter. Spoke with Cheney for fundamentals. Ran into Rose as we crossed the Midway. Grabbed a bite at Woodlawn. *La Cucaracha.* Met with Nancy from Trott. *We will live*. Apply for internships. Hopped on the holiday train with the transit club. Freezing. Snapped pictures of the train. Grabbed a bite at fourth meal. Stayed up editing our pictures.

In the south, the birds fly with impervious speed.
