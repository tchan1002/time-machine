Woke up lazy. Save the day. Grabbed a Greg shirt from the ihouse backyard. Had some food at Woodlawn. Left for the point. Final survival tribal. Fire challenge. Subbed in for Pablo. A day out at the point. Triptych, refraction of the heavens. Beautiful beautiful day. Aboo called. Hung out with debate. Debateâ€™s senior sendoff hijacked by a man on a bike playing Ed Sheeran. Did no work today. Get our stuff down tomorrow. Clean up the back of our hair.
