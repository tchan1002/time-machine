The snow is falling up. Dropped our MACS course, might just be too out of our depth. Called Katy. Have the day to ourselves. Sent Jay Kelly an email to cover puppet fest. Showered. Did laundry. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. She jumps. Soule Pole.

When Henry died, they put his frozen brain to an industrial meat slicer. Layer after layer of brain scraped away into a couple hundred MRI scans.

LA fires, David Gaber, we default to communism? 

Notes from a call with Katy:
[[Nowhere Collective]] is dealing with what we're thinking about: how do we translate connectivity to digital spaces? Does a re-distribution system need to be a marketplace? Would be cool to geomap material lifecycles.

Goals of our primary research: How much does a role does sociality play in consumption?
