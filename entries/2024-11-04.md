#### Must Do's
- [x] Psych
- [x] Susan Sontag Discussion Post
- [x] Finish Susan Sontag
- [x] Appdev Homework

Woke up at 8:00. Did our psych homework. Submitted our discussion post for Susan Sontag. Read Kafka. Signed up for one of Gabby Seiglie's studies. Beecher 412, a focus group on Dr. Simon Bramhall. [[Ugonna]]. Autographed livers. Lessons from Marty Byrd. "It's not the first time she stole, it's the first time you caught her" BM shift. Couple people came in to ask us where they could vote. One Spencer, who's a third year. Went back to North to sleep. Fine mist covering everything. Still in limbo as we ate dinner. It's still only 8 in the evening. Called Aboo briefly. Went out for dodgeball. Showered. Something about Murakami is so alien in the way that he explains things. Really did watch Despicable Me 4.

Zone in these last couple of weeks. Plan office hours for 6, 7, 8, and 9.
Especially before major assignments. 

Pete Buttigieg shook our hand this past summer.
We have to learn to drive. 
What's the dream really? Probably a couple thousand in our bank account so that we can take mom on vacaction or fly every other week to visit our friends. Do crazy stunts like travel and see things.
