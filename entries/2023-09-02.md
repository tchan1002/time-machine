Day 6  
Shanghai. 法租界王子. Went by our old house. Picked up our old phone number. Missed these old streets, the French planes. Saw a man carry an impressive train of chairs on a rickshaw walking back to Dad’s place. Dressed up for cigars with Dad. Snapped a couple pics on the terrace. Took a puff. Think it was a nice thing to do. Had some 西北 food for dinner. Showered. Mittermeier’s Tapajos saki. Wildlife photography could be cool. Slept.
