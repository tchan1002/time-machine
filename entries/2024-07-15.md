**Day 67**  
Past couple days have been a continuous onslaught. Lunch. Picked up eggs from Midway Mart. JD Vance. Walked up to Pret. Met with Abby. Got ourselves a fudge cake. Helped out some kids on a scavenger hunt. Sat in the Hutch courtyardâ€”applied for Metcalf. Ran into Anaemilia. *Microwave background.* Dinner at Woodlawn. Tagged Alex downtown. Music on the great lawn. Dacia dropped by. Got our tripod back from Faradawn. Tornado warnings. Storm made us storm chasers. Sheltered in a Woodlawn stairwell with Nat. 

Notes from a Meeting with Abby:  
O Party. Have a social event calendar. Get stickers/merch. Laptops make for great ad-space. People: Zach Braunschweig (fiction), Lillian Fu (fiction), Henie Zeng (poetry). 

Song: American Beauty by Drew Holcomb and the Neighbors. Verbatim by Mother Mother.
