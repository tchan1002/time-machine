Had a good chat with Joe on our way out in the morning. Grabbed breakfast at Bartlett. Went down to Rubenstein to hear Sammy present on medical mycology. Research could be a cool thing to do—or maybe we just want to make posters. Beef and rice au jus at Woodlawn. Picked up the PA for our launch party. Dumplings were a good investment. Ceremonial loaf! Karaoke with Chad. Dropped by Camden’s party at Deke. Sat outside with Clancy for a bit. Walked to Sam’s for Fire Escape x OLAS. Met Avery at the party, who we walked back to Snitchcock at 2:00 in the morning. 

If ever we trade our fiery jaws for snow white hair, let the wind take us to unknown lands.   
God bless the evangelists. He who controls perception controls reality.
