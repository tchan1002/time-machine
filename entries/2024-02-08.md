Religion. Ate with Lola at Bart. Went to Micro. Made an itinerary for our Mexico trip with mom. *Farmers are the backbone of any country.* A solarpunk future. Grabbed some salmon before CNVC. Creation myth. Saw a lion dance at fourth meal—met Aaron from the troupe. 

Mexico city itinerary:

Day 1: El Centro. Archeological Museum. Sunday night lucha libre (wrestling) at Arena Mexico.  
Day 2: Day trip to either pyramids/xochimilco (boats on aztec canals).   
Day 3: Mercados\! Easy day, food and buy stuff. Move in for our trek. Send mom to the airport.  
Must haves: Torta de lengua (cow tongue). Tripe. Horchata.

Think of god as visibility\! Our vehicle of transcendence is the semiotic image.
