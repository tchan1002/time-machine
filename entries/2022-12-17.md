Day 16  
Did not end up going to Costco. Fix our sleep routine. Adapted coolcat. Chloe back. Worked on Dominion. Played 20 questions with Gabby. Got ahead on Text and Performance. Can’t believe we’re taking a class on puppets. Ordered our books on Amazon. Caught up with Rishi from Exeter, he seems to be doing well. Life distilled into narratives.
