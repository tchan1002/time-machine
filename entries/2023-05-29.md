Day 102  
Legs sore. Good news from Sunshine Action. Updated our linkedin. Feeling mega-productive. Published our year in review. Off to good things this summer. Flowers continue to test us. To exhaustion, stress the organism. The sun god Amaterasu. Went on a night run. The drawing of an eye onto a Buddha, to awaken the spirit within. Tiresias lived through seven generations. Packed light for the summer.

Coolcat: One man’s advice for finding home was carrying an oar to a people who know nothing of the sea. A year ago, leaving home, I did not know what Chicago would bring. I thought my journey to the west was an exile, envisioned that I would be “marooned in the cold dark heart of America.” That could not be further from the truth. At a mock trial tournament this winter, I left a grey sweatshirt in an Iowan McDonalds—this was the farthest I had been inland. I like to think I left my sweatshirt there on purpose. A tribute. My friends, thank you, thank you, thank you, for your kindness, patience, and care. Three quarters in this beautiful city surrounded by beautiful people, here’s to three more\! Have a good summer.
