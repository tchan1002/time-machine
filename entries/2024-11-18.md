Woke up and finished psych. Marconi, inventor of radio. The A bomb and the internet. Hospital Beach by Cotton Wood Firing Squad. We are really happy. Wrote up a discussion post for lives of animals. Went down to logan to return our camera equipment. [[Webapp Ideas]]: Quote collector, recipe to shopping list plugin. Food is life. Ate with Audrey. [[Chef Toby Recipes]]: [[Kimchi Mushroom Dumplings]]. [[Wishlist]]: KÃ¶hler's Medizinal-Pflanzen in Naturgetreuen. Go see Ichiko Aoba May 6. Time is relentless, but so are we. Sorted out business.

Finish Appdev so we can grab that A. We can dedicate our thanksgiving break to making our assignments really really good. 

"We are a voice crying out in the wilderness." But there is no more wilderness. Never have we actually seen the desert or Libyan sands. Nowhere is unfiltered nor untouched, nay summer nights behind our house or down by the dunes. Supine in the water, we were really boundless then.

Every fiction is a cry of reality.
