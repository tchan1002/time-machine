Had a dream about leaving. Read the Phaedo before we go. Coolcat may serve an important purpose to stay in touch with people. Emailed about our CSO event. Talk to mom about going back later. Next eye dop at 12:30. Love Death and Robots. To spend life doing great things. Approaching divinity through contemplation. JF came by. Sat by the window. Talked to Claire about the future. Polaroids at Lamont tea. Origami cicadas. Robert Lang. Huzita-Hatori axioms. Black forest cuckoo clocks. Eight Elvises. Yoshizawa’s Cicada. Class tonight at 8\. Hylemorphism. The infinities of our intellect, to consume without destruction. Shower at the next hour. We’ll try to get to the quarantine unit. so we can walk outside for a bit. Moved to the QU. Grace, Rex, Enzo and Nhan are here. Played four squares, then basketball. Set up our room again. Jacqueline and Lara came to visit by the QU. Talked to Nick. Two more days in here. Called Aboo. Get comfortable. Come back to life tomorrow.
