Woke up at 8:00. Took our accounting and stats midterm back to back. Had a quick lunch with Raquel. Daisies, a 1966 Hungarian Short Film. Met with Mason. Nap. Reset. Took a stroll down to Cathey to eat with Ava. Connecticut kinship. Guido all dripped out. Went out to play soccer. The one man army was short lived. Got hungry. Dropped by Tiffins. Nostalgia trip. Stood for a bit in the ihouse courtyard. 

You will go out and break bread with strangers.
