**Day 60**  
Seeing Chloe tonight. Symbolism and Basquiat. Packed up our room. Stopped by Midway Mart to grab dinner. Abhay drove us to Midway. Rural Canadian roots. Ran into a women’s basketball conference. Jasmine from DC. Snacked slim-jims. Ginger ale (more often than not). Delassandro’s Cheesesteaks, Jose from Canaan, CT said to call ahead. Arrived in Philly past midnight. Took an uber to Chloe’s. Showered. Sometimes it is soul-crushing. Raindrops on rooftops. Curled up into a ball and slept on the ground. 

Critics panned the 3rd season of the Bear. “Annoyingly sluggish” “Stagnant” “Frustrating”.
