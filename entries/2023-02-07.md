Woke up and submitted our math homework. With Mock season over, get back to R2A. Walked with Clancy to Ekhart. Had lunch with Alex Fan and Robert. Sat in the reg. Scheduled our RA interview for tomorrow. Napped on the couches. Took a tour of old places on Google maps. Ate at Bart with Mikey. Filmed a video for Clark. Went to our lab. Vroom vroom. Had dinner at Bart. Walked home. Took a nap. Talked to Mark about RAing. Returned Taeâ€™s blazer. Had some Jumbo Wings. Watched Arrested Development and went to bed.
