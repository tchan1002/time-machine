First of May, spring rain. Woke up and walked to class. Ate with Michael Moran at Baker. Caught up with Isabelle on the A level. Security guarding at the ISAC. The Flaming Lips this Friday? Sat down with Judy again in the reg. Submitted our apes assignment. Accepted Sunshine Action’s offer. Ran into Gabby at Baker and had dinner. Walked back under her umbrella. *To be a worm*. *This girl*. Drafted a coolcat. Tuscan pane and gorgonzola and yada yada. 

Snippet: Windowshopped alternate lives at the museum. To be a Mayan living near apocalypse, societal collapse in thirty. Or a shop owner in the 80’s Caribbean. *Dad*, shame that we only had this life. Leave us this beautiful memory of the balcony. 愛回家.
