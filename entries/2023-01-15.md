Woke up and showered. Cleaned our room. Went to Woodlawn with Clancy. An American consensus on whether burgers are sandwiches. Walked back via a diagonal. Prepped for our soccer match against Chen. Sweet sweet victory to the Thompson Gregs. Had a quick bite with Josh at Bart. Sat in the reg for a little bit. Returned to ihouse. Listened to Sparkle from *Your Name*. The inner scream. Weary but never broken. Rise above the red dust. 万事尽是红尘. Heat up Szechuan food for dinner. Return to goodness. House council meeting. Banana bread bonanza. Finished our theater writeup. Visited Isaac’s room. Watched *Inherent Vice* with Clancy in the Phoenix lounge.
