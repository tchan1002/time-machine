Day 78  
Public holiday, no work. Moved out of Tai Po back to To Kwa Wan. Got Dim Sum with the family. Talked to Aboo as we were waiting for the bus. This is water, this is water, we can breathe. The titanic submarine incident. The survival film genre. Got back home. Took a massive midday nap. Resolved our network issues. Offered essay help. Watched The Boys. 

Ubasute, the way up the mountain. Recalling Aeneas and his father, the sculpture inside the Latin study. To abandon with piety? A natural progression of life, the Ballad of Narayama. 

Snippet: Had dinner with Angela a couple days ago. Last coolcat was a weak one. What is this guy talking about? Condensation of realities that suffocate. This is water, this is water. Proof of humanity. So much of why we write is to prove that we deserve to live. Recalling a scene in Avatar: Way of the Water. The scientistâ€™s monologue as the drill goes through a Tulkun skull. Some terrific irony to the idea of killing something vastly more intelligent, emotional, and *human*. As if our humanity is defined by the ability to engage in depth of thought and feeling.
