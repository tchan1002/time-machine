Coded in Copenhagen. Tomato souped. Foggy weather. Norwegian wood, crossed the Baltic sea. Finished our code and screencast in Hamburg. Stayed in the airport until 7:00. Dark out, took the train Blankenese bound towards Hofbahnoff. Turkish lady in the train, white sweater. A and O. Slept.

Realized how strange it is to be alone here.
