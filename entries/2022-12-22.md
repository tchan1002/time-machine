Day 11  
Cleaned Dominion data. Went down with mom to Wallingford. Times Microwave Services. Dentist did our fillings. Are we the new post-soviets? Took the bus back through New Haven. Was raining out. Hazy New England. Glutinous rice balls. Lauren from New Haven.

Dreamt that we had to compose a play in Greek, decided to do it on hippos. Ran around campus. Walking down an outdoors corridor, caught the concave corner of a building. Sunset. A hexagonal window, sectioned into triangles, in between two walls of patches of brick and concrete. Entered and climbed a stair tower into an aerial hub, glass-domed like a train station, with restaurants and shuttles running in and out.
