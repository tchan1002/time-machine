Day 16  
In the hotel all morning. Drifted into microsleep. Asifma. Quantedge was fascinating though. TBC. Three hour break. Followed Alicia and people to Chinatown. Peaky blinders hat. Went back to the hotel to meet Chris. Duck terrines at the UChicago reception. Augustin du Payrat. Took the MRT to Gardens by the Bay. Marina Bay Sands\! Supertree Grove. Bone against cement. Laid down and looked up at the dead trees.

Snippet: Looking up at the sky tree, lights off after ten, the windows of the observatory looked like ones we could drift up into. Anti-gravity. The city in *Upside Down.*
