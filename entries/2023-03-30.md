Met Ryan at breakfast. El Atardecer, the Marias. Sat down with Mimi and Zofie. Moved to the Stuart cubicles. Ran into Kobi. Cooking account. Drifted, we’re a drifter, drifting man. Gyttja, partial decay of peat. Mind-composed a coolcat on our way to Baker. It’s just been so nice recently. Ate at Baker. Jesenia. Soccer stuff. Thompson Gregs and Impostors. Sebastian, all our problems solved. Man is the goat. Kaan and Leo Lab partners. Drew the sun on a chalkboard. Made scale models of our solar system. Lettuce wraps at Cathey. Went back home and napped before our game. Went up against Wallert at South Field. Clancy as Connor Blake, and Sebastian as Aidan Coleman. Goalied. 6-2 Dub. *The planets of TRAPPIST-1 have determined masses*.

Prompt: Oscar’s Isberian Rugs. Rug-hitman service. Convenient body disposal—and cleaning\!  
Meta: Went on a deep dive through past entries. Call us this word nibbler, mind dweller. Two years on this log in a little more than a week. 

Meditation on exiting the pool: Exhaust the lungs. Stress the organism. Emulate the cry of a newborn. Beg, beg God for breath so that we remember how precious life is.
