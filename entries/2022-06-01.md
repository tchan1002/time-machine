Wednesday. Parting ways with our rug. Won the Hatch award. Talked with Holden about Deva. Exonian in the PEAN room, and PEAN in the newsroom. Something fishy. Hatch was a good 400 dollars. Our last Greek final. Practiced handshakes with Hartnett. Wrote Ardura a card and got him flowers. Dorm packing today. Withdraw cash from the atm. Put things in boxes. Had a good term with McConnell. A box for our desk. It’s the idea of our room. Did good work cleaning up. Went to the Committee. Look out for Deva. He’s digging and it’s not fast enough, but at least he’s looking up. Catch Nick tomorrow. Came back at 11 to the Browning boys around a campfire. Dorm auction, stories of Spanier and Alex Norton. Joe Hunt. The PGs were high watching Black Mirror. Belew, a master storyteller. Morgan (Johnson) and Morgan (Lee). Went up to the roof with the boys. Raining now, and the streetlights are empty. Did not go to bed.  
   
Had a silly dream about a ring-pop once. It melted in the heat.
