Day 10  
The Great Merge. Finalized our Dominion data. Went out on a night run. Felt good, have to keep doing that. Wong fu productions. Had glass noodles for dinner. Arhon called. The Zoolander resurgence. Check out the Popol Vuh. 

Doctrine: On a description of two people on a bench that gets progressively more detailed. Is there a point where all possible details are filled in? Imagine that this point of most-saturation, the totality of information, is a sort of realityâ€”if all forms of perception collect a subset of reality.

Snippet: Forget how alive we feel on night runs. Setting out when the sun dips beneath the clouds. Running on the winding roads and gentle slopes with only the sky above us. Under the pink of dusk, the rouge rolling waves, Mr. Brightside. Then in the dark, feeling as naked as when we were born. The cars zooming past, and the wind in our face\! If only others can see what our eyes capture.
