Ran into Clancy at Barlett. Caught up. Settled on the A level. An interview request from Heinz. Kingdom of Heaven. City of God. Sat with Rose in Stats. Bart midday lunch rushâ€”things are good again. Went to our religion class. Love the way Haydt speaks. *Avail yourself.* Acquired a lanyard. Went to look at posters with Marcell in Reynolds. Got samosas and an eel friend from the quad fair. Walked back to North with Vanessa. Took a quick nap. Put on a dress shirt and left for Polsky. Ran back for our Campus North staff meeting. PHP might be a pyramid scheme. Figured out workday stuff. Changed our lyft home address from IHouse to North. Slept.
