Woke up and packed our things. Left for the airport with Ashley and Niara. Ready to go home. Mexico was rough on our body. Finished Siddartha on the plane. Waterloo Sunset. Pink waves over Lake Michigan. 6 flashing lights in the distance. Lyfted back with Adam. Showered. Slept.

Exhausted the self so that we could become anew. We’ve become quiet. Build up again. Don’t mess around, if we find someone we really like, invite them to picnic out on the quad.
