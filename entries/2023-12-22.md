Day 12  
Scott Pilgrim. Alien of extraordinary ability. Hot pot for lunch. Cleaned the dishes. Gaylord, Cloby, Cloanthus, now Clomobile. Got to be a dog. Shoot at f6 for the sweet spot. Tried going out but it was just way too cold. Cold burns. Looked through internships on handshakeâ€”do something cool that will take us places. Hong Kong again?

Prompt: Camera organica: the first biological camera. A dying eye revived, meshed with a digital interface. Watching and screaming.
