We're at a 3.80, keep building up. Explored Neunkölln, Körnerpark. Neat little gallery. Think more about microbes. Virus-taming. Wandered through an artstore, then a humana thrift. Stopped at a Turkish supermarket for some haribo frogs. 清真牛肉拉面. Took the train to Ostbahnoff. Walked the East Side Gallery/old Berlin Wall. Julie and B. Had some schnitzel. Traveled back and showered. Hung out with a couple people. Met Johnny who's working in Dusseldorf.
