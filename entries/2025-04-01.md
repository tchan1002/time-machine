Went so hard on ourselves this past weekend for no reason. Slept in. Skipped class. Ran into Matteo for Lunch. Rubber ducky's. Senator Cory Booker spoke for 25 hours. Took Fred's invitation to Boka. Diana drove. Sat next to Warwick. 8 course meal. Devil in the details. Raced back to make tacos.

What Daniel Feng, Oliver, and Matteo are all telling us:
define the thesis of our show. i.e be selective about speakers
"Stay clear headed, keep working" re: Oliver Drazky.

OpenWorm is constructing a digital twin of the c. elegans nematode, down to the molecule. First virtual animals coming 2026.

Boka thoughts. 
Mushroom tempura: crunchy good start.
Foie gras on brioche, umeboshi: strong but good.
Tuna crudo: the sliced onion on top was impeccable, good crunch, yuzu sauce was goated.
Asparagus: such creamy sauce for the best parts of the asparagus.
Tortellini: the filling was insane. so hits the spot.
Tasmanian ocean trout: the sauce with roe was so rich, the trout also just melts in your mouth. loved the little radish cubes? nice refreshing texture.
Venison: very juicy, too bad we had to finish it so fast. 
2 deserts did not have.
Bread was really nice.

In terms of drinks, loved the smoked citrus black teaâ€”tasted a little like ginseng.
The spirit-free wines were cool to drink. 

Decor wise, loved the accented low lighting. Little ceramic cupped candles, flowers engraved. Ceiling panels were also nicely floral, reminiscent of New Haven Union Station.
