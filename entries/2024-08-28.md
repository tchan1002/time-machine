**Day 25**  
Met Ms. Rose at Whole Foods, who showed us pictures of her pomeranian Toby—a little white dog. Her grandkids are “covid babies”. The Tearsmith. We make too many excuses for Italians. Lara and Maya made dinner. Went out to meet Luques and Georgie at Taichi Boba. Saw Jacqueline’s room. Anne Chen. Just a mile between Georgetown and GW. Facetimed Arhon on our walk back and Aya from D-Nik picked up. Watched Five Feet Apart with Maya. Wharf-dog. Stayed up till 4 talking about gratitude.

Two more years of the superpower that is being a college student. Get people to help us.  
Squad drafted for the battle bus.
