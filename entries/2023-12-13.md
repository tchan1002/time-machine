Day 21  
Fundamentals fell through. Make a video for dad for his birthday. Made dinner. Did little today. Went out for a three miler. Start tomorrow with a run—try something different. Figure out add/drop. Sophia Emy’s coming back in the winter\!

Make our first film reel (Hello World)   
Make memory collages for each month.   
All about visuals. Be cool\!
