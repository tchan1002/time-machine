Day 93  
Grabbed a Japanese breakfast with Mom and Chloe at a canteen. Train crossings. Put our jacket over our head to block the sun. *Donâ€™t incur the wrath of the pompompurin*. Took the train to Narita. Ran into Alexa Murat from Exeter. Watched the Arnold Schwarzennegar biopic. Sunset flight. Watched Batman on the plane. Zoe Kravitz. Aboo and Gonggong picked us up at the airport. Visibly older. Took the bus home. Showered. Slept. 

Eyeball cameras, approaching verisimilitude.   
Write and ask about the book press job.
