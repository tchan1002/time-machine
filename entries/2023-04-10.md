Slept in. Mystery of Love. Walked to Baker for breakfast. Settled in the reg. Went swimming. A return to fishdom. Ran into Alex and Leah at the intersection of Ratner. Leah said our hair resembled that of a Macaroni Penguin. Ran into Elijah at Baker. Stayed and hung out on the quad with Adrian and people. *Have a whimsical eve*, he said. Walked home, Idle day. Richard W. James’ *Prelapsarian and Antediluvian,* clothed monkeys of ceramic and cloth. Lizzy McAlpine, Michigander, see where the Maroon takes us. Vlog in Hong Kong this summer. Grabbed cuties for Gabby. Sat down by the Masaryk Statue and pushed her around on a skateboard. Smell of citrus. Blue-tongued by peeps as the sun fell close to the horizon. Gabby vampire bat. Zoomed Grace about our VC internship. Walked to Woodlawn and had a bite with Jack Monday. Stephen Fry and Christopher Hitchens. Arrived early to tribal. Farnsworth’s idol was a fake. Blindfolded for our challenge. Pablo and Olivia. Had fourth meal at Baker. Met Oliver, Farnsworth’s second cousin. Took a tour of Rishi’s room with Oliver and Clancy. Showered and went to bed.  

Dad, what a shame that we only had this life. 

Dreamt that we had dumplings in a Chinese restaurant and that college was awfully close to Chloe. Dropped by her Latin class. 

Song: Saturday Nights by Khalid.
