First of November, third of May. Eeked out our interview guide. Printed it out at CCSS. Psych discussion section. Lunch with [[Mikey Bean]] and [[Indelicarto]]. Stopped by Hallowed. Horchata, cinnamon and rice milk? Abstain from dairy. Sleep early. Sloth is sin. Met Ellie at the north bus stop, took the 55th to pick up 姥姥. Ran scenes in Logan. This movie can go pretty far. Back at North. Made a little dinner. Nap and catch up. Did laundry. 7:00 skated down to Jewel-Osco. Onion soup with [[Lola]].

Onion soup recipe:
Onions, butter, shaoxing rice wine, egg, salt, water. 

[[Keep in Mind]]: We need to separate what we like doing from what we like *the idea of* doing. The key? We *do* what we like doing. (cf POSIWID—the purpose of a system is what it does.) We are what we care about.

What do we like doing? Memory curation.
What do we like the idea of? Content creation.
Our conundrum? Our activities are too private, we need to figure out a means of dissemination (writing, photography, podcast, video?)

Head back on the bus seat. We are clothed, we are fed, we can think, we can feel.
