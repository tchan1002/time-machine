Day 48  
Make breakfast. EPVN drafts. Write. Return to Hillsdale. Bob Odenkirk in Nobody. Long term nuclear waste warning messages. Semiotics. r/rbi. Triptychs. Call aboo later. Crepe and pancake, two sides of the same coin. Stood and looked at the bushes. Steak. Watched ratatouille. Ego, what a professional. Wake up and get cleaned. We’ve got to do better than this. Reset.

“This place is not a place of honor… no highly esteemed deed is here…nothing valued is here.”

Prompt: A boy named Copernicus moves to a quaint new england town and finds the stars in his attic. The former house of an old poet.
