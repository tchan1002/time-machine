[[Keep in Mind]]
#### Must Do's

Morning. Afternoon. Past Lives. Met Chong at the BPSB. Our first look at a EEG headset. Watermelon 1. Went for a half hour swim at Ratner. Grabbed some food and watched the superbowl with D-Nik. The Eagles. Onima's fermented koji hot sauce. Called dad. Bad call. Our legs hurt. Stayed up and watched Before Sunset. The what-could-have-beens.

Song: Cats and Dogs by the Head and the Heart.
