Filed in our student marshal app at 11:59 last night. Woke up at 7 to prep and submit our human communication discussion. Back to bed. 9:00. Met Chong at the lab. Touched first EEG Headseat. Chong appreciates tea. Seoul taco for lunch, round table of Awh Vogel's lab. *Your Ed, my Ed*. CB + Internet Art. Bean soup from Logan. Grinded out our attention and WM assignment. Time time time time time.
