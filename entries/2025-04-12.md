[[Papam]] at Cesare's (Julia Morales). We can do flower's Moby for two minutes. Eat well. Deleted discord to free up space in our mind over the weekend. Went on a run. 7 miles. The moon, glowing, glowing. The Bleacher's About You. Filled out fafsa with fam. No such thing as a weekend.

We can't be unaccomplished with a shitty personality.
