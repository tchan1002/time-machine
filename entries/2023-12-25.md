Day 9  
Christmas day. Took the Metro North down to Grand Central, then the 7 to Flushing. Had Dim Sum. Took some pictures of a siu mei shop. Boarded the Long Island Railroad to Mom’s friend's place. Met Hassan, a Fulbright Scholar from Pakistan doing climate infrastructure at Worcester Polytechnic. Convo sponsored by the sticker on his backpack, a cold approach. An *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* kind of sky. As if the beach at Montauk. Feasted. Met Dave at UIUC and Mike at Deloitte. A convo across three languages. “Multilayered thinking.” Immigrant stories, 中国合伙人. Aboo called. Camille Saint Saens’ *the Swan*. Bombs in Bethlehem. 

Mug shawtys. Spaces they inhabit.   
Night of the Wolves—a survival thriller about a Colorado rancher's family.  
Past lives. If language is not just an interface of the self, but a core.   
Make an anthology series, talk to Aboo about her life. 

Middle of January, it was snowing hard in Chicago. We touched down in Irvine and thought it was paradise. 

*Oh man, bro’s a dreamer*, *looked at that boy so starry eyed.* Summer changed us so. Moonlight molting. We will never forget that hunger, that piece of sky afforded to us by the balcony, that rabid dog foaming at the mouth. What's the v in tobyvfitness? Ben Vigneri. What's the w in tobesphotog? Will Park. Composites of composites, so much hedging on a win.
