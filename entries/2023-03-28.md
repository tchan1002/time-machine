Three AM Math Dub, A and future insured. Slept in till 9\. Woke up. Got dressed and walked to Woodlawn. Greek yogurt and bananas. Great time talking to Emberlynn. A culture of public writing and general mock tomfoolery. Woodlawn photo-op. *I love big dairy*. Ran into Alan on the way to the reg. Settled in the Ekhart library. Did no work\! Wild Hunt—Motif E501. Called Eric about Survivor. Moved to the Reg. Devin. Met Alex Torres at the bookstore. Plot-changing conversation? Grabbed a quick dinner at Baker. Went to wopo. Body sore, build up our stamina.  Ghost Riders in the Sky. Walked over to Cobb. A little bird kept us safe from Tribal. The politics of a cup game. Lost the challenge but acquired an immunity idol. Stealth. Called Eric, we have a buddy. Liquify the tree sap. 

Snippet: Bored in math, so we invented a game of morphonyms. Take a word, add one letter, drop one, change one, or switch two until it resembles another word. I give you thus: Frog-frag-rag-rage-cage-cave. 

Alternative game of morphonyms: Thor’s Father, Odin, gave his eye at the root of the world tree. *Sigmund Freud would say Odin castrated himself.* Unlike Odin, Attis did castrate himself for Cybele. He gave his blood and body to her because he was Unworthy of (Her) Love. Unworthiness makes *Taxi Drivers* kill presidents, or try to—at least.
