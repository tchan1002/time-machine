Woke up at 7:20. 6 eggs at breakfast. Lincoln and Jefferson. The hypernarrative of our generation. Vincent. Sharpened our pencils. The ancient tradition of doubting oneâ€™s heritage. Bombay. That chapter feels just like Shanghai. Weth lines are absolutely packed. Crows in eden. Had bananas for lunch with Jacqueline. Ran into Holden. Sat with Holden and Jasper and Aidan. Absolutely butchered by our Greek test. Picked up our copy of There There. Keystone literature. The Last Question. Peacock Godzilla. Picked up a red button thingy. Hung out at grill for a bit. Went for a recovery. Gps got a little wonky. Felt good though. 8 pull ups. Give maybe two days' time. Called aboo. 

Rome must burn today.
