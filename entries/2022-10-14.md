Bouts of fatigue. Woke up and went downstairs to grab a wrap. Took the shuttle midway on the midway. Linguistics. Need to reset. Had ice cream at Baker following Greece and Rome. Walked back to ihouse with Sophia. Took a nap. Finished and submitted our gradescope. Max called. Slept. Almond a novel. Didn’t feel like going out. Ate at Tiffin’s. One bite pizza reviews. Won our first three man pool game with Sergio and Devin. One for Cartoon Network. Destroyed again at soccer. Locked ourselves out of our room. Called Chloe.
