**Day 115**  
Grabbed breakfast, caught up with Megan Cui. Went down to Ida. Bethany helped us out with the rest of the Sunshine Action food bags. Made a trip up to Roger’s Park. Cyril, our Nigerian uber driver. *Igbo* breaks the ice. Back down. Grabbed a quick lunch with Joe. Summer Housing Training—GGRC Drift. Check for pay on 31st. Went out for a night run, always choose to save the day. Bought ourselves our mic. Now we have to make our grad video. 

Stranger \#1: Cyril, our Nigerian lyft driver, admitted that he wanted to reject the ride when he saw us initially by the roadside with our 70 sunshine action bags for delivery. He was not happy but we broke the ice when we asked if he was speaking igbo or yoruba when calling his wife, brother, and kids. We talked about having family across the water. He said he moved to the States a couple years back. Texas first. Then last year he moved to Chicago and now he makes business shipping parts of broken down cars back to Nigeria. 

Priority 1: Set up substack—daily dispatch.

Megan told us to look into an $500 amtrak package.
