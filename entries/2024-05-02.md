We scrape by. Wrote to Buyan about rewriting our religion paper. Think we got frustrated about recent events. Dropped by Ida to talk with Bethany. Have a clear plan for this week now. Stopped by the maps collection. Gangs of Chicago. Conzen, an unfortunate resemblance to Eustace Bagges. A 125 paged term paper. Geography’s last stand. Recouped for a couple hours before Sliced Bread. Picked up two loaves from Medici. Bass, fish theory. Went back to North and made kimchi scallion pancakes. Called Chloe for her birthday.

Have to rise above subsistence, and maybe that means starving for a bit.
