Day 18  
Looks like we’re reading Omeros. Le Chat Blanc, Pierre Bonnard. Learning the military method for falling asleep might pay off. “The Rest is Silence.” Asimov’s guide to Shakespeare. Give Hamlet another read. Smurfed protobowl. Heisman, he is man. A host organism for storytelling. Osho. Went down to buy groceries. Texted Annalisa. Latin Mnemonics. Doggerel Rhymes. Cave paintings. A history of art. El Greco. White Pocket Arizona. Eco-brutalism. The Trickster. Do a 1990’s spin. Our college party trick. Called Annalisa. 

Prompt: The koi jumps over the dragon’s gate. The salmon swims back up-river. Narrow is the strait that only few make it. 

Snippet: A little black cat crosses the street. Its eyes, two moons, stare straight at us.
