Showered up. Met Jati at the paint shop. Gojeked to a nice neighborhood by the river. Met a man cutting down bushes with a sickle. Followed Jati to see him tag a place with a well.

Had dinner with Bapak Prijo. Bapak Prijo's going to hook us up with some Wayangâ€”even scored us a wawancara (interview) with the troupe during practice monday.
