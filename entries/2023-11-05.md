Ran into Clancy and Lincoln after they went to Mormon church. Caught up with Inah. Grabbed breakfast at Baker. Walked to Reynold’s. Snapped photos of Clancy. Watched Anderson do Mock. De la porta. Midlands is really international. Went to our editors meeting for Sliced Bread. Introduced Alexa to Phoenix. Ran into Evgenia and Noam at Bart. Took the L up with them to Thalia Hall. Bonny Doon and Slaughter Beach, Dog. In the photo pit. Lyfted back with Daniel, Nic, and Josie. *From the corner of 3rd and Washington.* Went to Noah’s apartment to go meet her girlfriend. Generations of the New England establishment. Guangxinyang. Got back to our room and sorted through our pictures. 

In the photo pit, in front of the boombox—the reverberations were hitting us, we could feel the music push us back as we posed to snap the band in different lights. 

Apply Universalism to Behind the Lens. Eliminate noise from our scenes. Contrast light and shadow.
