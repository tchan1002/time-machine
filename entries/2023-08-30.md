Day 9  
Dim Sum with the grandparents. Took a solo trip to Shenzhen for an errand. Felt dizzy midday. Revived via Yoghurt and Lan Zhou Beef Noodles. Picked up our card at 工商銀行 and returned to Hong Kong. Took a detour at Tai Wai to go see monkeys. Fucked around and found out at Kam Shan Country Park. Snapped a couple of cool pics though. Monkey business. Overpass became a no-go. Had to stop a passerby to cross the street together. Bus took us to Mong Kok. Walked home via Ho Man Tin. The pink sky. A calmness. Walk home was really nice. Got back home and packed our stuff.

Snippet: Out of the elevator, a tap on the shoulder, she turns around, “係你呀？”   
“好耐晤見, 你點啊？“ This is what people mean to each other.
