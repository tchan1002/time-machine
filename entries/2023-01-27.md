Nick coming over this weekend. Drafted an email to Fernanda. Handed our keys to Erik. Picked up our laundry from the dryers. Went to Hum at 9:30. Ubered to O'Hare with Elijah and Isabella. Did our theater write-up on the plane. Read some of Calvino’s memos for the next Millennium. Slept. San Francisco\! Sergio the Bartman. Olivia Rae saved us from an angry man. Met Love on the Bart. Arrived in Berkeley. Japanese houses. Hotel room mishaps. Checked into our super 8\. Had torta for dinner. The flan\! Went to sleep with Elijah. 

Hum planning: a “choose your adventure” but all choices lead to Thyestes eating his sons. The sinking of teeth into a bloody heart. Print out programs. 

We practice that Catullus 5 sorta rizz.   
The noetic realization that we live in a world superimposed upon this one*.*
