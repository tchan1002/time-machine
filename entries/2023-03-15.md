Left early to catch the train to Florence. Bravado. *Igualmente*— said a friendly Italian vecchio. San Francisco by the Mowglis. Approaching the gentle green hills of the Italian countryside, the little brick houses and the fields of green. Florentine flowers. Paramore. Bookstore\! Mango toucans on a magazine cover. The Italians are fans of Murakami. Found Calvino’s books in Italian, *no surprise.* Checked into our airbnb. *What if the frescoes were painted on?* Had a mean seafood spaghetti at Zaza’s. Tuscan cuisine. Pulled up to Dante’s place, walked around his Florence. Would love a sick red cap. Gelato *crema come una volta*. 

Snippet: Scene of the mind. Nightfall. An Arizona shopping mall parking lot. You in a loose black jacket. Wind and neon cacti. Summer nights\! From Grease.

Florence night scene  
the stone church’s weathered faces  
construct of memory   
eternity of night.
