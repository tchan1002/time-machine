Apes\! Flight. Watched Stardust. Long train home. All’alba vincerò\! How we subsisted off fleet foxes finals week. The sun is in your eyes. Whole foods bathed in violet streetlights. Reconstructed the past couple of days.

Coolcat tagline: *Spring lover, moon lover, this moment in amber type of deal, gratitude for the little infinities.*

Big cleaning when we get back to Chicago.   
Change and put our sheets in the laundry.  
Throw out paper from our cupboard.   
Reset everything in our wardrobes.
