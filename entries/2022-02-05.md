Woke up at 8:00. Had breakfast with Shalom. Went to the Library and played scrabble with Stella. Volcanic sulfur mines. Fruitarianism. Had a nice conversation with Daniel about Amsterdam. Did laundry. Ran into Joy in the music building. A big fan of ice dance. Went out to grill and had a good time stringing beads with Jasmine and Zara. Moon-lovers. Thought back to how Kai kept a list of our sayings. 

I put the last remnants of the moon in an Altoid tin.  
“Here we are, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.”
