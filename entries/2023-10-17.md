Grabbed breakfast at Baker. Settled in the A level of the reg. Bang out work. Didn’t go to our micro lecture. Ran around feeling foggy. Took a good nap. Compiled a list of concerts we’d like to go to. @theavenuemag. Called Indigo. Called family.  

Snippet: The bioelectricity of mushrooms, their fourth dimensional screaming.  
Song: Evangeline by Stephen Sanchez. Kokomo, IN by Japanese Breakfast.
