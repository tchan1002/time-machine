**Day 13**  
Rouge skies over Ohio. Back in Central Time. Chicago, concert in the Jackson Red Line station, Bears fans stream out at Roosevelt. Stopped at Clancy’s, who set us up with an air mattress in the basement. Dropped off our stuff. Walked to Trader Joes for some food. Tuscan pane and garlic dip. Ran into Geneva, who invited us to eat and talk in the Cloisters. Talked extended families, tribes of 50+ people. Geneva’s mom is starting a commune—just women and kids though. Stopped by the Robie house, signed up for a tour. Settled in the reg. Reconstructed our New York Days. Stopped by Jewel-Osco. Made dinner. Watched from Dusk till Dawn. Decided to sleep on the basement couch. Which was pretty comfy. 

Do Saul-esque stuns.   
Figure out how we study abroad in Edinburgh  
Do research. 

Notes on Frank Lloyd Wright: Prairie school, organic architecture. What is a place without walls? Compressed ceilings communicate intimacy. Rooms flow into one another. Standing in the main room, looking out towards the prow, it’s like being at the helm of a ship. 

Human instrumentality project.

When couples argue with each other, it’s not about money or power or sex. What they’re really saying is *you’re not enough people*.
