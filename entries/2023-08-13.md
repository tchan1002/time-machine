Day 26  
Read Kafka on the Shore. This little piece of rock. Went out with Aboo and Gonggong to Lok Fu. Picked up jeans at a Uniqlo. Had lunch at 一粥麵. Came back. Aboo gave us a perm. *For the mems*. Day felt like a real trip. JF Called. Called Eric Han, who we had not seen in three years. Was a really nice day. 

Snippet: An old habit of checking for the light in our eyes. Though it is just a reflection of the iris, much like how the moon has no light of its own. We feared being dead rock.
