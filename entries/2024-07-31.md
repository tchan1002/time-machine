**Day 51**  
Day trip into Center City with Chloe. Coffee at Saxby’s. Walked to Reading Terminal. Had Cheesesteak from Spataro’s. Populations: Alzheimer’s specialists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Liverpool Fans. Explored Oldtown. Saw the liberty bell. Grabbed some iced tea. Septa’d to the Rocky steps. Ubered back to Chloe’s. Picked up our stuff. Settled in a room in Huntsman. Applied for Head Arts editorship. Bumpy flight back to Chicago. Met Tony and Sophia, an old pair who had taken a weeklong trip on the east coast and Eric, an archetype of *bro* visiting for Lolla. Arrived in Chicago. Took the 59 bus from Midway back to South. Read Kerouac on the way. Slipped by the front desk into our old room. Showered. Popped our backpack in the laundry. Play it day by day. 

Again the Sears tower watching over us like the good shepherd/ and the 12-foot cigar store Native American off South Pulaski.

Sitting in the bus at the airport bookstop, we looked out to see a young couple in embrace. First, he was lifting her in a mock supplex, then she was doing it to him. It was tempting to take out our camera. There’s a visual language to intimacy. 

Dreamt that we spoke to Obama. He was much younger and a visiting lecturer. Asked us if we had an hour to spare and tossed us some Marx he was teaching for a class.
