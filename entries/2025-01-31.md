Breakfast with Moran. Settled in a Stuart Cubicle and banged out our long due articles. Lunch with Nolan. Stopped by Harper for a FLAG panel. $7000 towards Indonesia summer would be great. Sent out emails. One thing we do miss about high school was how easy it was to build relationship with teachers. We need mentors. Night. Head out to DJs. Left shortly after. Paced about corner of Midway and Ellis. 

Good writing is clearly postmarked, has good flow, contains zingers. (in that order)

Because we're not American, no peace corps, no Washington. We probably would have liked to enter politics. We're in a One-Piece Age of Corporations. There are the sharks and the bottom-feeders and the whales.

Best thing that came out of building SB was probably that we became the "I know a guy" guy.
