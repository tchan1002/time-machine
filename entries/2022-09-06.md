Day 14  
Woke up and packed. Rain was pouring out. Left at 1:30. Took the bus. Wrote about trains at Union Station. Our mac screen died onboard. Arrived late to dinner. Carmine’s Italian Restaurant. Thomas Grant’s laugh, an interesting introduction to Chicago. Apple Pie. Met Isaiah from Wisconsin. Walked with a group of business kids around Time Square. Daniel McNeill. Two hours into a conversation. We’re in good hands.
