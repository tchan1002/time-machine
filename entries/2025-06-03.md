#### Must Do's

East rail line, lo wu crossing. A river's width, two destiny's. Crossed the border to Shenzhen. Lounged in the airport. Carapace ceilings. Flight back to shanghai. Figured out our VPN through UChicago connect. Cisco any systems. Dad came to pick us up. Feeling like we need a lot of work. The airbnb is two blocks from where we used to live. Familiar streets.

When we're bad at something, what we really mean is we're not used to it; just like the first time we went climbing at first ascent with Matt and Jarcher and felt our fingers bare. At some point it must become possible. The only way to get better at anything is practice.
