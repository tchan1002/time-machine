We’re tired. The sunlight’s nice though. Took pictures for Lekha. Grabbed soup at Baker following religion. Sat in a windy spot for micro. Ate with Natalie in the hutch courtyard. Idled on the quad. Ellie’s rosy glasses. Went to our trek orientation in Ida, then Firebird. Grabbed dinner with Francisco before going home. Shower and clean up. Traded clear skies for thunderstorms. Got Lola to go to fourth meal with us. The eugenics of bananas. 

Nostalgia for winter. We miss Culver’s.   
Hours spent idling on the quad, give not into aimlessness\!
