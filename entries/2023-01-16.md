About Time. Walked to Bart. The birth of a stone-cold playah. Reg closed for the day. Moved to Hutch. Death at Exeter. Indigoâ€™s birthday. Ran into Mitchell Handsome. Isabella came and joined us. Sat down with Phil, Jeffrey and Don from Soule. Will Mohler. On arbitrariness. Grinded out our galaxy's homework with Sergio. Returned to ihouse. Went to Woodlawn with Clancy. Gunshots, not fireworks. Did our math homework in the third floor lounge. Giancarlo told us about a kid who killed himself at Lawrenceville. Smile dog. Checked in on our friends.
