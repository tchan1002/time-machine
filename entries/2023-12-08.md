Stayed up all night and bombed our exam. Felt the invincibility leak out of us as the clock counted down. Ran into Ray Simbiri at Bartlett, who cheered us up. Pick up where we fall. Rest and pack for our journey home. Had dinner with Moran and Josie. Snap out of the Kali Yuga. Did our laundry, go home clean. 4 hours.

Have to define ourselves by our own excellence.  
Get pictures with people, not just of people.
