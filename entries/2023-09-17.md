Had lunch at Woodlawn. Took the redline downtown with the O-Aides—Rose, Reem, and Ha. 63rd, between 12 lanes of traffic. Deafening. The epicenter of badness. 5 dollar rug. Monroe. Got ourselves a little friend from 5 below. Glizzy the neon wiggle worm. The parable of the three sons. The father gives each a hundred gold coins to fill the room. Bricks, feathers, and candlelight. Room design philosophy is coverage maximization. Caught up with Erik at Nella’s. Had a damn good prosciutto rucola. Walked around the quad and talked. 

Met a man dressed all in red on the red line. He had a crocodile skin blazer with a matching pair of shoes. We told him his outfit was fantastic. 

*Doesn’t he look like Ezra Miller?
