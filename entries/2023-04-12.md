Woke up and walked to our Polisci lecture. Back to school. Show up to Apes tomorrow too. Butter for breakfast. Exoplanets, what a fountain\! *Alien astronomers on distant exoplanets.* White canvas shorts. Le Soleil, Baudelaire. Climbed a tree on the quad with Veronica. Grabbed Indian at Hutch. Wandered ‘round. Sat in the Stuart cubicles and listened to music. Left for the quad. Volleyed with Audrey and friends. Three men in black shirts, canvas shorts met for Survivor. Two dragonflies in the evening, passing by Max P west en route to Ratner. Tread water and talked with Rick. Ran into Yuto in the locker room. Walked and talked with him, Ratner to Logan to Midway Mart to South. Jo said we’ve become the Orator in survivor. Murakami and Your Name. *Jerk off and go to bed*.

Alec asked us if coolcat was for art.  
Sun tanning, tanning leather, man cows.

Snippet: The Eurasian Pole of Inaccessibility, so Ulysses finds himself in Urumqi, the name of the street we lived on as a kid. So long, so long, and miles still to go. Antipodes and long journeys, a world’s end in La Quiaca.
