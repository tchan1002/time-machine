**Day 84**  
Foggy out (foggy in). Cooked cucumbers. Morning shift. Age of pessimism. Dinner distraught. Listened to Lua. Frisbee-golfed in the courtyard. The sun came back. Joined Raphael and Adriana on a Target trip. Got madeleines. Ran into Moran. El cucubano, the Puerto Rican firefly. Thinking of quitting our job. Media wind-up (?)

Moved fridges, and moving under South’s labyrinthine passageways, realized how a bad mood had annihilated whole days from our calendar. Always think we need to do something drastic.

*I admit it. We’ve got a pretty weird idea of how the world works.*
