**Day 98**  
Pay day—north of 3k now. Lazy start, stocked 2 rooms in the morning. Chicken schnitzel for lunch. Walked down to cottage grove after our shift. Got a call from Sarah and Brittany about dozing off during work. Damn. Turned back. Had dinner at Woodlawn with Courtney. Went home. Made ourselves some caramelized onion and egg pasta. Kind of a downer day. Saved the day by going out for a 3 miler. No excuses. Wrote our manifesto again. Looked back at entries from the end of last summer. We need to make an exponential jump\!
