**Day 87**  
Went to the IOP coworking session. Got some Rajun Cajun. Met Nick and Nahir working on the DNC. Good to be with other people. Dropped by the Maroon office in Ida. Find a way to make it a work space? Settled on the second floor. Made our first app via a Code with Chris tutorial. Brought mangoes to Vanessaâ€™s. Streetcar by Daniel Caesar. Crochet flowers in a bucket.

Haptic touch.
