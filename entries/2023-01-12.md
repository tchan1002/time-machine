Woke up at 5:40. Went to Kuvia with Clancy and Gabby. Took the diagonal en route to Crown. Think *we’re* uncomfortable with silence. Swing danced, followed, did not realize the roles were cross gender lines. Moved to Breakfast at Bart. Clancy bought us an iced tea at the Grounds of Being. Think we live the life of an ascetic—no alcohol, no drugs, no coffee. Hamlet and Orestes. Went to our math lecture, meditation time. Returned to ihouse to nap. Met Ryan at the Reg. Had dinner with Ryan and Ethan. The Pooh Pathology Test. Went to our lab section. Paper star on a yardstick. Rushed to mock practice, left our charger. Visited BJ afterwards. Went to Elijah’s room for cups. Long Island Iced Tea at Henry’s. Had raising canes from the BJ RDs. Elijah called us a lyft back.

Snippet of Clancy: The perfect ratio of hot men and sultry women on vintage posters. Riding the line between lecherous and questionable.

Snippet: Memories preserved in amber, fragments like insects caught in some awkward stance, sealed forever. So take this fragment: Night of Halloween. Went trick or treating. Came back and asked to cuddle with her cookie-monster onesie on—she took it off and tossed it at us. Fuzzy blue like a shag rug.
