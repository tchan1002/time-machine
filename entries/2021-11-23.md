Symptoms of Loneliness  
What else is the human condition?

I wish you knew that the blood of my heart spews like ink to this page when I sing of the incredible warmth of your spirit and the incredulous radiance of your being. Your smile makes me equally hot and coldâ€”for at the same time that I see the twin suns of your eyes, I realize that you cannot be mine. You are overwhelming warmth, unbearable lightness, and immeasurable pain. How can I stop your sweet laughter from snatching me into ruin again and again?
