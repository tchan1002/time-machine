Matahari terbit. Head out before dawn. Ran first towards the gunung api, then did a ring route around our neighborhood. The market was already full at 6:00 when we passed it. 3 miler at a nine minute pace. Dropped by senam. Went home for a nice bucket shower. A bee the size of a small bird. Big old geezer dilly-dallying among the flowers. Set out for school. The story of Dune. Rata Rata with Sander saja. Took a gojek back home. Played a little angklung and showed Bapak whiplash, because his gesture for louder reminded us of it. Good tired, rest. Knocked out completely. Schlept. Called dad for an hour. Booked our plane ticket back home. All-fiber with the amount of bananas we're consuming.

Once a moment is gone, it's gone.
Good to have movement, drink water and get active for the fall.
Will be a big win if we can keep up our waking early habit.
量身定制, tailor made.

Take note of how Bapak and Ibu are staying active. 
Need a good grounding. Long form.

Win at conventional metrics first:
Get a girlfriend
get a job
get a company
get a car
get a boat
