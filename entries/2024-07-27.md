**Day 55**  
Chloe back home with a couple of gifts for us. Figure out how to make our Kiev 30M work. Wrote and submitted our RNC trek reflection. Took our pennyboard down to Audi’s for some groceries. One-way glass behind the cashiers. Strawberries and carrot juice. Texted Sho. A pickle for the knowing ones. Prepped cola chicken for tomorrow. Made some really good rice. Steak and tomato eggs. Went out for a 2 miler. Steep hills. Go to bed and rest up for tomorrow. 

*No, what we’ve been battling is not some idea of loneliness. It’s more structural than that. Road-space dominated urban geographies, exxxcessive media hyperrealities, doom narratives—we’re dealing with the effects of American Domestic Life. The day in-day out, 9-5, groceries, netflix routine. And to understand ADL we must look into the American Domesticated Mind.*

Self-kritik session 1 (though keep in mind the prognosis is positive):  
We often misdiagnose the source of our problems.    
We need to commit to our relationships with people and projects in order to make them fulfilling.  
We pursue many things for appearances—which is par for the course—but we lack internal- element. We gain that by seeking earnestly how we can serve and make people’s lives better.
