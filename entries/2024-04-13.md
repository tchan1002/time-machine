Write to Joe, straight grind. Worked on our stamps app. Ran into Aidan Grogan at Hutch. Sat outside and had a really good convo in the courtyard. Greek 5 cheese spiral fiasco. Drink water so we don’t binge eat. Idled a little too much today. We can dig at it. 

Have to do stuff to prove. Website/video. Get a skateboard.

Notes from a conversation with Aidan: If we take the dating analog, minimize friction at all points. Call to auto-scheduler to meet. What we’re tackling is the challenge of turning matches into dates and the challenge of setting up a time to meet.
