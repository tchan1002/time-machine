Woke up early to visit the Uffizi. Over 190 types of flora in Botticelli’s primavera. Think back to the Buddhist mural at the Met, what is art’s sake? Italian folktales—Gerusalemme Liberata di Torquato Tasso. Armida by Cecco Bravo. Focaccia sandwiches all'Antico Vinaio. Hiked to see Florence upon a hill. Returned to the airbnb and napped. Asked for directions in italian: *mi scusa, dove mercator centrale*? Listened to Maroon 5’s Daylight and started missing school dances violently. Our last dance, hitting up the dance floor at NJCL. Frats are a poor facsimile. When were we last submerged in the pure ecstasy of each other?

Snippet: At the intersection of Florentine streets, a dome of emerald and marble. Sea-green, cerulean in the morning wind. Then the uffizi, the poets, dante petrarch boccaccio, encased in marble. Pillars made their sarcophagi. Ecce\!
