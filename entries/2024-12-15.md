Morning. Showered. Got some rest. Checked out of A and O and walked over to the Mariott. Hung out with Isabella and Ben Rowley. Went out to a coffee shop. Something warm. Doner #1. Boats in the harbor. Christmas market by Rathaus. Kunsthalle. [[Phryne before the Areopagus]]â€”we saw with our very own eyes. Profoundly jetlagged. Went back to sleep from 3 to 8. Woken up by our roommate Baltazar. Doner #2. Baltazer works with [[Ben Heim]] on peak caffeine. What a guy. 

Bare the breast.
