24 Days left. Chloe bday tomorrow! Stayed up last night watching the Borgias. Went to our CC discussion section. Lunch with Michael Moran. Talked pope. Called mom about [[Big Indo]]. North basement. The vending machine speaks. Chopped short our hair. Ran with run club. 4 mile to the point and back. Showered. A nice ice cream and orange tea. Fucked around today, which tomorrow will sadly have to pay. At least we got exercise in. 

A testes in pedentem, do you have the colones or not?
Want it badly enough and its yours.
Don't forget the motto: do cool things.
Big indo: get a volcano pic.

Get ahead while we feel good. Lots under our belt.
Stress glows us down severely.
Eat well, sleep well, work out.
