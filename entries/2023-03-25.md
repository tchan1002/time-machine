Woke up. Had some cuties before wopo. Team brunch. Frozen fruits and cream. Walked back and did our laundry. Gotta grab ourselves a sewing kit for our green pants. Walked to Woodlawn. Ended up having butter chicken with Noah and Saul. Returned home and picked up our laundry. Peter Brugel the Elder’s Netherlandish Proverbs. The Fleet Foxes cover. Head out into the sun. Used Olivia Rae’s swipe to get a poke bowl. Sat next to Bill for theater 24\. You, me, her, fish, uncle\! Spectacular. Celebration of theater. Lyfted back home with Mitchell and went to sleep. Vigorous in spirit, but sore in body—the flesh is weak but the spirit is willing\!

If our eyes make us villains, I, Tiresias.   
Midnight we sat outside Kimbarks. The buzzing LED’s. 

Snippet: The afternoon sun, straight on, bathed us in light. Perhaps a serendipity of astronomy, or perhaps, my dear, there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
