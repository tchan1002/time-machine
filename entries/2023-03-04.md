Woke up and showered. Meditated on Manichaeism. Listened to RADWIMPS. Arhon and Thomas Wang called us. Mergel Funsky day at the the Reynolds club. Copped two pairs of Mergel socks. Ate at Bart with Ray. A forest meal—mushrooms and lettuce. Sat on the floor of Reynolds as we caught up with Thomas. Early dinner at Hutch. Ran into Norton on the way back to ihouse. Talked to Ben in the homeroom. Got into Survivor.

Snippet: Can’t help but think about Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane. His closest apostles napping against the roots of the olive trees, though he asked them to pray. How alone he was in the moonlight\! Embrace the pure light, and we will find salvation from this hollow prison of our flesh. 

Dream verse:   
*Stranger, from across the bay,*  
*good luck with thy woman make.*  
*Let tears not flow from her face.*
