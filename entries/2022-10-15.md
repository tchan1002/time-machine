Woke up. Called Dad. Called Holden. Walked with Aymane and Connor to meet Jack, Rohan and Brian at Woodlawn. Took the red line down to Chinatown. Had rice noodles. Checked out a candy store. Bought cakes from a grocer. Chicagoâ€™s Chinatown is bizarre. Got windy on the L. Took refuge in a Checkers Burgers before hopping on the wrong bus. Passed Englewood and ended up far west of Midway. Took a lyft back. Grabbed dinner at Woodlawn. Keep ourselves warm. Showered and freshened up. Worked for a bit in the third floor lounge. Austin Powers. Called the health center about our exacerbated cough. Not feeling the best tonight. Gabby gave us some cough drops.
