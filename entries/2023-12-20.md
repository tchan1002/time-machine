Day 14  
Two weeks left of break. Chloe’s coming back tomorrow. Dance dance revolution. Cleaned the dining table. Fight entropy. Head out at 3:40 for a sunset ride. Went seven miles down to Quinnipiac at a chill 8:42 pace. Farther than we’ve gone before, saw the sleeping giants. And holy shit a fox. The *vulpes vulpes*. Haven’t felt this good in a while. Show mom the spot some time. Made egg fried rice. Rotisserie chickens goated. Had an editors meeting at Sliced Bread—outlined dates for next quarter. Went down with mom to buy Walter’s camera—he gave it to us for 20 dollars. Today was really nice, call Aboo tomorrow. 

Recommendations from Carter Beckstein—go see the Lyric Opera and Chicago Symphony Orchestra on student tickets.

The body sore, some flagellation for our god.  
Song: Come on Mess Me Up by Cub Sport. The Blower’s Daughter.
