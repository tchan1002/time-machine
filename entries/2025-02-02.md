Slept in. Ripped our pants at Baker. Back up to work. Called dad. Submitted our FLAG grant. Hot ones. Joe used to be the station manager for his college radio station, WRUR 88.5. Pasta night. Talked with Nick about WHPK. Ran through red carpet looks with Lola. Gracie Abrams killedâ€”fondness for shawls. Scored again the top score for consumer behavior. Finish our readings and bang that one out.

What questions do we have for Chris Lacivita and Xochitl Torres Small, former head of Agriculture?

Song: Focus Ring by Sufjan Stevens.

Need an enders-game-esque appraoch to life. At all costs. 
Sell the story of our lives.
Make emails informal again.
