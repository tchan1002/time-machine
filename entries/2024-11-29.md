To do Friday:
- [x] Meeting with Raghu (1:00pm)
- [x] Buy Sony [[Wishlist]]

Zoomed Raghu. Drew out an ERD of our Maroon Email Sorter. Bought our gear. Hamburg, Norwegian Wood. Called Aboo briefly with Mom and Chloe. Went out and walked half a mile. It's getting cold. Showered. Would be crazy to pull up to school with a rickshaw. Cleaned up.

Remind ourselves frequently of who we can become.
Kiki Montparnasse.

When we're back at school:
-  Take a new linkedin photo.
