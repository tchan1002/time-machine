#### Must Do's
- [x] Task 1
- [x] Secure booth campus access

A week since we've been back. Woke up at 7:00. Went to Dimsum with aboo and gonggong. Took the train down to Choi Hong. Put stuff out then edit. Met up with Sunny at a diner. Stopped by Mong Kok. Lowkey rip off prices for a phone case. Dad’s blog circa 2008. Weird to read it. It’s kinda corny. Decided to go home. Showered. Aboo interfaced with Chatgpt while we were speaking to it in Indonesian. Wolfe 666 and Indonesians don't have last names. These have been good days. Finally published UCSP at 10:46pm. Went out for a drenched 2 miler. Showered and all before 12.

No new projects.
