Woke up. Had breakfast at Bart. Ran into Helena. Heralded for Greece. Boris Johnson. Gods and men, parallel hierarchies. Chia pudding. Classics was fast-paced. Sat in on another section. Think we’re going to stay with Moreau. Ran into Jeff on our way to the reg. Read for a while in the basement. Ate at Bart and took the shuttle back to ihouse. Lily. Took a fat nap. Annotate our Iliad. Learn how to press and laminate flowers. Went to the third floor lounge to do math. Gradarius is not our friend. Do laundry and clean our room tomorrow.

Doctrine: The addition of new information does not equate knowledge, for knowledge is the conscious choosing of what information to accept and reject.
