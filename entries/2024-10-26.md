#### Must Do's

Leisured. Showered. Woke up properly. Sent emails to Mina and Zac thanking them for meeting with us. Guess we just resigned from Sliced Bread. Had an omelette for lunch. Where are we? Called [[mom]], who's at [[Chloe]]'s parents weekend. Slaughter Beach, Dog. Food. Picked up eggs from bart mart. Ran into [[Lukas Grunzke]], who talked to us about applying to the CNVC with his language learning app. Dinner. Slept. BM shift at Reynolds. People stream out of Mandel in costumes. [[Devin]] is in a green dinosaur onesie. One Where's Waldo and a couple girls in ties. 夜郎自大. We don't feel like doing any work. Everyone's going to hear the university symphony. Guang came by to talk the latest advancements in Amigo. [[Amigo Pilot Ideas]]. Credibility is king. +1 will recruit our first disciples for “the supercollider” (group matchmaking event). Zero in.

Bureaucrats kill art. Must resist bureaucrats. Must resist death.
