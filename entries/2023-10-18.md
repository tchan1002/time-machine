Settled in the A level to knock out our religion readings. *Destroy Superabundance, Starve the Flesh.* The Aganna Sutta, a liquid earth reminiscent of Calvino’s Cosmicomics. Had lunch with Leena. Talked to Vanessa before heading to religion. *The spidery gesticulations of Professor Haydt.* Met Emily outside Hutch. Dropped by restore with Erik Ely. Grabbed dinner with Alec and Lekha.
