Stayed up late last night. Slept in. Woke up and went down to Baker. Alec. Fish and Chips. Sat in Harper for a bit. Napped to Diplo’s Daylight. Had an emergency meeting with Lauren over Sliced Bread’s annual allocations. Jian Park, how do we tunnel this. Went to our Authoritarian Regimes class. Met with Josie. Napped. Made pasta and did our sosc reading with Lola. Rose made her eggs. Two people were fucking with the lights on in Behar. Blinds open, in full view of the DNik Kitchen. Gratitude journal. Brushed our teeth. 

*We’re grateful for this pasta and for the company of our good friend Lola.* 

Out of this quickly vanishing past.  
Sliced Bread wants to be a real boy.
