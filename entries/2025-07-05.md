#### Must Do's
- [x] Do laundry.

Did our laundry opposite Wisma Bahasa. Moved into the Kos D'Mara. Could use a good cleaning, but lofted bed hopefully offers work-sleep separation. Stopped by indomaret to grab some liquid. 1000C lemon vitamin injection, 10,000 Blueberries. Booked ourself a massage at Djemari Reflexi. Had our massage. Full body. Got some rest. Wedang jahe shot. Green Chili Burger from Suburbuns was the wrong move. Sambal monster. Pedas sekali. Absolutely destroyed our stomach. Place was cool though, skate trucks for door handles. They make good smashed burgers. Showered.

Places we'd like to visit
Puppet Moon Theater
Wayang Gulit.
