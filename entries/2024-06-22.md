**Day 90**  
Morning shift. Walked over to woodlawn. Sat and watched Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Slept for most of the day. Scavengers Reign, an orgo-future. Showered. Changed our sheets. Called Aboo and Mom for an hour. Good to hear from family. Weâ€™ve been kind of at a low. 

Improve sleep schedule? Food fuels leisure. Drink ceases want.   
Start tomorrow by responding to our texts.
