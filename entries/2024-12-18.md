#### Must Do's
- [x] Read [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin)

Hopefully we feel better soon. A couple rainy days in Berlin. Wrote back to Creed, a high schooler we met at the end of last summer touring the Robie house. Shinju. Went back to our hotel and slept. Woke up rightly at midnight. Went out with Baltazar again to Teras. Doner #5, though this time we also had a baklava with some turkish tea. Madmen again. 

Beware of the tautology of experience.
DLTKD: Don't let thinking kill doing.
