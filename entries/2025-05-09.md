#### Must Do's
- [x] Financial aid
- [x] Indonesia visa application

Get back to Earth. Submitted our financial aid application. Figured out Indo. Went down to Cathey for lunch. Ate and worked with Sergio on our fictitious tech firm. Mandatory ayahuasca brainstorming sessions, underground wrestling ring. Played pope monopoly at MADD. Hadestown, we patently sobbed. 10:30 back at North. Thrifted eggs from Yuen, made kimchi-egg-rice with Thomas. 

Notes on looking back. Stephen Tagle. Two poems on Lot's Wife. Like to think when the shaft of light hit Orpheus, he just wanted to share his joy.

Benadryls really did sponsor a quarter of rest and relaxation.
