Day 15  
The meteoric rise of one Mr. Beast. All trajectories, just a matter of time. Cleaned up our room. Clean up our things. Sent out secret santa assignments via an automated script. Sliced Bread: Morph. Getting l’Oreal careers ads. B+ on our financial accounting—not bad. The mercy of Nikolaev. Sent an email to Sanderson, figure out our classes today/tomorrow. Our driver’s permit is running out in a couple days. Cranked out 5x20 pushups. Put a stop to jerking off—texted Moran.

*Foresight for our age has put us squarely among a rare company of peers those who stand “in symbolic relations to the art and culture of our age”. Manifest our destiny\! Use the first hours of tomorrow to clean up our room. We got this\!*

Meta: Good weather permitting—go out to Sleeping Giant and take a panorama. Join substack, write from the personal. December 9 of last year, we wrote: “Our compass—knowing that idleness destroys, turn our mind towards production. Make it our life’s mission to engage in dialectic and participate in the evolution of thought.”

Objectives for Q5 (a test of coolness, the impossible dream):   
Publish an issue of sliced bread. We need a schedule to ensure this.  
Take on street photography, film content like reels.   
Get laid. This is not a joke.
