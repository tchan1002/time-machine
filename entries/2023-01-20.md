Woke up in the hazy morning. Walked to Ratner. Swam. Maddie’s a lifeguard. Sore. Mitchell swiped us in at Bart. Thought we lost our ID Card. Was about to replace it when an email from Ratner came in. Had breakfast with Phil. Matthew Clemson was in our DC case. Tense moment in class over the Rape of Helen. Had lunch with Bill and Rohan. Moved to the Stuart cubicles for our writing seminar. Talked to Tommy about Avatar. Native American eco-ethics. Braiding sweet grass. Eywa, the ecosystem as one organism governed by one consciousness. Returned to ihouse and napped. Intergalactic. Lights off, spicy noodles and root beer. Some time alone. Took a nap. Aymane. Fortnite in the third floor lounge. Had a slice of matcha cake for Ryan Michaud’s birthday. Played ping pong downstairs with Aleksander from our writing seminar. Went to Lambda with Clancy and Rishi. Stepped outside of our comfort zone.
