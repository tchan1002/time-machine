**Day 73**  
Late start. Does not look like we’re making it to the dmv today. Grabbed lunch with Cole. Effective altruism advocates. Went 4 miles down by the lake. Was pouring out. Got soaked. Walked around Kenwood and Bronzeville. Japanese houses. Took the X4 bus back. Picked up beef and tomatoes at Jewel Osco. President Obama cream soda. Showered, cleaned up. Captain America, apotheosis of the chamber. Made a midnight snack with 刀削面 and 滑蛋 with tomatoes. 

Make ourselves a portfolio website. Adobe portfolio is free.  
Mussels and onion soup mom used to make.
