Bazzi. We’re halfway. Went to brunch at elm. Knowledge and goodness. Summer plans, pick French back up. To be well-learned. Digamma. Went to Wheel Tea. Our flower tie. Played frisbee golf with ring toss. A skeleton butterfly. LinkedIn profile pic acquired. Took some more Zyrtec. Roman banquet. Broke bread. Hung out with Holden. Felix and his galliambics. Catullus and Attis. Go look for ice cream. Sat in the library for a bit. Dinner then moved to the Puzzle Hunt closing ceremony. Fell asleep in assembly. Read Oscar Wilde in the library. Front street tea planning. Hung out in the library with Jacqueline. Ma Vie de Courgette. Big diomede and little diomede. “Our little infinity”. A lunar eclipse. Do laundry tomorrow. Go on a run.
