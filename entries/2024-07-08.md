**Day 74**  
Went out to woodlawn with Manar. Revelations. Sat down with Erika at South. Submitted our TBMG article to copy-edit. Hung out with Alice. Did more drivers ed. Settled on a law school bench. *Sunburn* on repeat. Here comes the horde. Put our maroon articles on linkedin. Carter Otis. Create create create. Prepped dinner with Lucy. Used some of that cooking wine. Went for another run with Faradawn. Dropped by CVS on our way back. 5 miles. Red pill-core. Showered and had dinner with Lucy. Chrysanthemum teas and we’re in HK again. Slept.
