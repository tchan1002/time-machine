Had a dream. We’re going downhill. Finish Electric Sheep. Having titles be first words. Saw Tommy Orange. Rituals of life and death. Met Tommy Orange. Joy Division. Think we’ll do Norwegian Wood for our print. Took a nap. Went to LCC at 6\. Forum this weekend. Do laundry. Quid est “Has”. Messed around at Kirtland. Played some games of Mafia. Talked to McLaughlin. Make a move. We’ve gotta do something. Don’t think we’ll likely be able to do laundry tonight. Waking up at five to do laundry seems to be the plan.

“The electric things have their lives, too. Paltry as those lives are.”
