First snow on Halloween. October Country. November Sky. Went to our Micro lecture. Had a good talk with Lucy. The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy. Met Thomas at the Reg for interview prep. Went down to Cobb Cafe to talk to Josie about *I wish to be beautiful and haunting.* Murakami’s ghostly women. Grabbed our camera to take pictures. Stopped by a Mock Trial scrimmage. Do miss it. Talked to Zane about film. Made eggs for dinner. 

Recommendation from Zane. Sculpting in Time by Tarkovsky.  
Slow motion down to a trance. Pan the shot, keep the frame.  
The Burning House in Tarkovsky’s Mirror. 

Art as Technique. Schlosky. All about defamiliarization.  
How does the mind reconcile the bizarre?  
How does one accept that which is odd?

Be intentional.  
Light, word, and flesh. The word is embody. To become someone. To be a master of the body.
