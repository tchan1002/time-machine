Woke up at 7:00 to a brilliant pink sky. Had breakfast. Flies, genetic simpletons. Thom Gunn. Outer banks. CROATOAN. Socially responsible economics. Ammit, devourer of hearts. “A soul naturally Christian.” The corner of Saint-Germain. The legends at pirate bay. TBF AFK. Had lunch with Sophie. Jugartha. Carmen et error. We are both the marble and the sculptor. Remember to spend grill bucks. Got our latinized name for the Classics Diploma today.

“He understood the leprosy of the leper, the darkness of the blind, the fierce misery of those who live for pleasure, the strange poverty of the rich.” De Profundis
