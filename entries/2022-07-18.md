Day 64  
Ran errands. Sorted things out at the bank. Credit score’s dystopian. Sort out EPVN drafts. Get started with Green Leaf. Felt hopeless today. We’ve got to make it. A Dream by Edgar Allen Poe. Lac Troi. Airplane Chess. Stratego. L’Attaque. Board Games. Dark. Go visit the library tomorrow. Get back on track.  

If everything goes to shit, can I still remember you fondly?   
The past is but a waking dream now.
