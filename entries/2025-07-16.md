#### Must Do's
- [x] Buy notebook from toko merah

Class in the morning. Almost at the end of book 1B, we're flying with impervious speed. Slept for 45 minutes in between classes. Hotplate lunch with Jati, Tash, and Lily. Boosebus, bindies, honkeynuts, maccers. Bought a notebook at Toko Merah. Clear-covers and soft rubber binders. Showered at our kos. Maynard by Wormy. Stopped by superindo kotagede before walking back home. We needed an intravenous injection of vita coco. Got some laughing cow cheese. Sunset and kuching-kuching. Aurora's into poetry. Wrote our first poem in Indonesian. The pantun. Talked with Ibu Dian after dinner about Chinese diaspora. The sembilan naga. We really are the jews of asia. Good rest and take the hill tmr. Clean up, shave, work out.

Otium et reges prius et beatas perdidit urbes.
The nongkrong. Hanging out is a relic in America.

Walter White was a penjual obat jelek. Narcoboy dealer. Our cultural exchange has been exchanging memes.
