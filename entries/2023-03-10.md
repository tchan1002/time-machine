Woke up early in the morning to finish our Galaxies final paper. Packed and picked up our vans from millennium station. Lyfted to midway. Odyssey getting to New York. Took the train to Thomasâ€™. EJ. Had a Horchata and a quesadilla from Los Tacos No.1. Watched Creed II and Catch Me If You Can with EJ. Fell asleep.
