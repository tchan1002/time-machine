Wrote a lewd poem about Emily Dickinson. Fire day. Spent E free with Cam and kids. Back on the gigachad train. Roman coinage. Method of loci. Cycles of rebirth. This week seems to be a rebuilding week—perhaps a good time to remember why we made this log, not just to record time but to preserve living. Oblivion. The fault in our stars. To Amsterdam. Went out to think under the stars again. Bought eggs from Trackside. Signed Aaron’s petition. We lose every day, but we just have to get back up now. Solid day. Make dinner. Start with test corrections. Poor nations paper might go crazy.
