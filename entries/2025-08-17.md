#### Must Do's
- [x] Oliver Drazky Interview
- [x] Write to Joe and Cristi

Morning. Congee at hawker center. Stalls territorial with the tables. 東筦佬. 客家人見有嘢做就做. Crossed the border with Aboo and Gonggong. Lunch at a mall. A Good Gut Feeling. 3 hours spent editing Oliver Drazky's interview. We're getting faster. Link up with Matteo Caloia and get his thoughts/help. We will soon be redeemed. Published. Checked out climb spot. Think we put our money in. Crossed the border. Passed the checkpoint. Misty mountain. An hour train to dinner with Abhir on the island. Talked about his Turkey experience. Post-grad plans. No 1 typhoon warning, rainswept. Covered though on our walk home. Still went out to go run. Raced randos—think we did three or four miles.

Nature, she will hang the night with stars so that I may walk abroad in the darkness without stumbling.

We have the ingredients to make it
[[Who's On?]]: we change the style—don't think about validating or quantifying our guests with metrics. we write personally in the way that we know the people we're interviewing. they're cool not because they've achieved this and that, they're cool because they're doing something they believe in. keep it casual—don't use numerals to number things. what does each person have to talk about?
