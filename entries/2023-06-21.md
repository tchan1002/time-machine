Day 79  
Woke up at 9:00. Took the train up to Fan Ling. The mountains by the border. A dog on the street when we left Ta Ku Ling village. Visited a temple. Crispy taro fish. Took the train back and showered. Bamboo scaffolding, mesh on concrete. Napped, then got dressed. Took the East Rail Line down to Central. Met Russell outside the China club. Shook hands with PRaw. A copy of the Asian. Talked to some pre-zuck Browning alumni. Had a terrific Salmis Ox Tongue with Russell at Tai Ping Koon, Chinese restaurant circa 1860\. Took the train home. Someone playing Stand By Me again. Stayed up watching Star Trek 2009\. A midwest intergalactic shipyard. 

Snippet: …Two weeks into my summer in Hong Kong we first heard it. Always the night commute back to Tai Po on the East Rail Line… Escaping from the city to the mountains that sprawl most of the city’s north. The green was some place to go back to. Started thinking that Stand By Me was some sort of old promise between a pair of lovers.
