Doctrine: Let the statement be, if one possesses a certain property, that which is derived by that will also possess the same property. So said, a lake has the property of water being fluid. But what is water constituted by? And is that thing fluid?  Molecules. Molecules are fluid. But what are molecules constituted by? Atoms, and atoms are not in themselves fluid. That said, a clarification must be made, a derivative possesses the property of its root, but not only the properties of its root. And as the root of all things is the atom, the most fundamental property of all things must be being. Being is the first state of the world.
