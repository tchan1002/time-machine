Woke up a bit late today. Dreamt about Thanksgiving dinner. Keep end in sight. Back in the grind. Reddit goated as usual. Went to Elm and ate lunch at the wrestling meet. Erged with Jsselyn and Cindy. Had some Atole. Ran into Cam in the music building. Find some time to do laundry. Christopher Columbus.  Remember why. Made eggs. Jasper taught me Tengwar.

Pickup Line a la Grace:  
Why donâ€™t you teach me how to wrestle?
