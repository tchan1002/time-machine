Day 14  
Did the dishes. Had eggs with a buttered croissant. Life can be so pleasant. Two weeks left to go. Doc films. Semantics and semiotics. Mise en scene. Finished our theater homework. Worked on Dominion. Cleaned ourselves up. Turn things around. Become a mock god. Bitter melon, *momordica charantia*. Stepped out the kitchen sliding door to dunk ourselves in the cold. Felt alive, recalled a memory of the Pacific. 

Snippet: Fall, past 9 on the grass fields of the midway. Dark that we cannot see faces, the ball escaping us frequently. Bumped into you and said sorry. Not accidental. *Would you guys like to play us again next week?* I said.

Song: Sunkissed by Khai Dreams, Grace. Afterlife by Benee, Move-In Day senior year. Superstar Shit by Dominic Fike, Senior Winter. The blue nights we walked back to Browning down Elliot Street.
