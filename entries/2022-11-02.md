Had a quick breakfast with Joe before Greece and Rome. *Facilis descensus Averno*. Asian American Manifest Destiny. Ran into Matteo at Baker. The Cloisters. The disappearance of Plato, retrieved from the Muslims. We’re free. Go run. Build ourselves up. Chipotle roast beef sandwiches. Called JF. Called Holden. Napped. Went to walgreens with Sophia. Bread and cold cuts. Resigned from our poetry workshop. Shape our priorities. Went to Walgreens with Sophia. Got ourselves some bread from Trader Joes. Went out to run. Felt good—rough and sore. Honey green tea in the fifth floor lounge.
