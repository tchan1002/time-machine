**Day 101**  
Gochujang egg sandwich for breakfast. Runny yolk. Made ourselves a cooking video. Printed and posted our flier in the GGRC lobby. Walked over to the point. Met Jacob, an archeologist. Showed him our urbex expedition to the Damen silos, and he showed us some abandoned mineshafts in New Mexico. Walked back to campus. Teresa Tung’s 月亮代表我的心 playing from the bell towers. Had lunch at Woodlawn. Ate with Rebecca. Caught up. Got our wireless mic back. Grabbed dinner with Juliana. Met her at 10:00 for a run. Went 5 miles.

**Why greatness?** Man must emulate God with his creative nature. Shape the wilderness. Joan of Arc of Mongolia. We have a responsibility.  
**How great?** The conscious self must create structures for the unconscious self. Two approaches: raise the conscious self more often \+ create better structures.

Stranger \#4: Jacob was drawing in a sketchbook when we approached him. He had just moved to Hyde Park a couple weeks ago from El Paso. He’s an archeologist for the private sector, which, in loose terms, means due diligence for defense contractors and oil companies looking to excavate new sites. His work has taken him all over. We showed him our urbex expedition to the Damen silos, and he showed us some abandoned mineshafts in New Mexico. He also showed us pictures of what appeared to be a 13th century Navajo settlement, with corn still left in the granaries. It looked exactly like that exhibit we saw in the field museum.
