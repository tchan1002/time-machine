#### Must Do's
- [x] Psych Homework

Slept in. Met Moran outside of North, took a lyft to the courthouse. Took pictures. Left at 6:30. Finished Kafka on the Shore in our lyft back to North. RA RH meeting. Keep track of our income (and expenses). Learn to drive when we're back home this thanksgiving. SITG grant? What are we doing this summer? Sleep and do some homework. Richy Mitch and the Coal Miners' Lake Missoula. 

Nap and do our work. Reminded of when we used to huddle in the hallway. "Fear is the mind killer"

Thanksgiving Black Friday wishlist:
New phone?
Sony A7IV with a 24 to 70mm (or find other full frame options)
