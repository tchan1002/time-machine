Orange smoothie. Weather’s brilliant outside. Get this Nicaragua thing done. Sent email to Herrick about course change. Krish being savage on Exeter compliments. Drafted email to Mr. Wilson. Gretl’s in New Haven this break. Went out for a run. Day students we never know existed. Eric waiting to be picked up in the BHaus basement. Bring up the issue of integrating Day students during Fac Proc.

Memento: It happens without cause, it happens without reason, and all we can do is take it.
