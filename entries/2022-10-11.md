Woke up and showered. Halcyon. Calc. Email about the weekend workshop. Ran into Andre. Read our Mock case packet at Bart. Vanderslice? How do we become something? Reviewed Felder v Koller Campbell Air at Barlett. Going for scud running. Went to fourth meal after practice. Walked back with Riley and Mikael. Do laundry early tomorrow. Push out a coolcat post.

This query of the absurd is to be observed  
Oh and we do mock trial now.

Song: Halcyon by the Paper Kites.
