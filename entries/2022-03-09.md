Woke up to snow outside. The 502s. Inherit the wind. Harvest moon. A devil at the crossroads. Holden Quaresma. Res Gestae. That crazy sonuvabitch. Actors who played Hitler. Pick up the sad banjo. Stress the organism. Ekphrasis. Gore Vidal and the Aleutian Islands. Williwaw. Hays Code sucks ass. The new corpus. Oaxaca. Grad on the horizon. Revisionism. Just did 40 pushups in a row. Make use of opt in the spring. Go run in the parking lot. Wake up early tomorrow and make good progress on Catcher and the Rye. Grimus. The Edge of Seventeen. Who wrote this movie? Stuff’s hilarious. Doors or wheels. Nhan’s got a good argument about blood valves. The expanding definition paradox. Did laps around the parking lot today. Felt alright. We can definitely go longer though. Do upper body stuff. The edge of seventeen is sorta like ladybird, but at least its funny. 

Epiphanies? Consequential summaries? I think it’s going to be easy sailing from here old sport. The future is secured. We just have to work towards it. And whatever comes, it happens without reason, it happens without cause, and all we can do is take it.
