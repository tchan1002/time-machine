#### Must Do's
- [x] Grab stuff from Logan

Grabbed breakfast with [[Bianca]], who showed us her feature length screenplay in Pret. Nixie time clocks. Went down to our Lab section. Dropped by Logan after. Lunch at Cathey. Carrie and Lowell, Dorothy Day. Paul emailed. We're on for Polsky's SBDI this winter. Looked through Basquiat's paintings. Checked cameras out of Logan. [[Paolo]] helped us set up a Sony G70. Arrived at Booth strapped. Dropped things off with [[Eric Harwood]]. [[Ellie]] took a picture of us with Lao Lao. Went back to Booth to film Ravi from Hype's talk. Trading memes. Stopped by Rockefeller for choir. Hung out with [[Tori]]. Went out on a run. Hung out in her room. Got back, showered. Called downstairs to address over-intoxication. Talked with [[Daniel Mata]], who's applying to fundamentals. Man we love that guy. Lunch with [[Mel]] sometime next week. Get some sleep. Much stuff to overcome tomorrow.
