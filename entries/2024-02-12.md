To greener pastures. Talked to Dante from Haylon. Grabbed lunch with Oia and friends, then Bianca. Bit the bullet and got ourselves an adobe subscription. Ran into Rhea as we left investments. Got her to send us “You. Me. Her. Fish. Uncle”, which we saw at our first Theater 24\. Sergio and Devin. Met with Martina. Something about agave farmers. Got our micro midterm back—it’s definitely doable. Scorcese’s Raging Bull.
