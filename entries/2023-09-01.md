Day 7  
Nam Cheong. Visited a warship with Dad. Had some real spice for lunch. Took a cab to 滕王阁. Row of lanterns. Took the train to Shanghai. Got to Dad’s place. Cigar labels stuffed in bottles. Three fridges. Showered and slept. 

Doctrine: Light, word, and flesh.   
If language is not just an interface of the soul, but something deeper.  
Shed one of our most enduring narratives, what next?

Song: Welcome Home, Son by Radical Face
