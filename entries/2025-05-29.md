#### Must Do's

On the plane, Before Sunrise, the Brutalist. What if Ethan Hawke's character was right, that modern souls are piecemeal reincarnations, so we need more of each other. It's a halfthought.

Made our landing. Half a day lost to time. Aboo, Gongong, Chloe, Mom came to pick us up at the airport. Took the A43 Sheung Shui bus to New Territories. Chloe showed us an indoor track that we ran on. Was pretty cool. Introduce motion. Dinner, fish shrimp, cabbage, Choko/chayote with eggs (buddha's hand). The TVB cast of 爱回家 is a Theseus' ship. We no longer recognize any of the characters, despite it being the same show. 

We trudge along the continent. Below us a field of cotton, and above us light feathers.
In the 50s, a wave of literati emigrated to the outer rims of Empire. Left the cities for the fields. 下乡青年. What's their headspace. Can we envision it?
