Day 22  
Accompanied mom to the eye doctor. Took the bus down to New Haven. Ran into Sydney Kang at a crosswalk. A town called Amity. Full view of West Rock Ridge. Had lunch at a nice little Thai restaurant with teru teru bozu dolls hanging from the ceiling. Walked back two hours. En route, birds of prey circling. A mound by SCSU. Passed Battis Road (An Old Grave). Dropped by CVS and Audis. Good convos with mom about silly things, felt really fulfilled. Published a coolcat about Q4. Make our films tomorrow. Got our stats final back—damn we bombed this quarter. Guess the mighty must fall. Multi-portraiture of people in their dorm rooms.

Living has been a recursive pursuit, we settle on the same themes. Of late, art as telepathy—and how the constraints of that telepathy can be meaningful, as in film grain (re. Brian Eno)

Snippet: This body \[this text, our body\], our body \[a photograph\]. Whether light, flesh, or the word encases our psyche, we hope that you’ll be able to spot us.

Doctrine: Some insight into the social character of poverty—that it is not merely a lack, but a system that reinforces itself so that even when there is overabundance, scarcity will be created by artificial means—divisions drawn up arbitrarily. Made so clear on our bus ride, this racially segregated society of ours.
