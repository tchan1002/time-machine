Woke up at 6 again. Managed to get a shower in before Rushdie. Went to breakfast with Anderson and Ben. Ran into Ms. Komarek inspecting a water fountain on the quad. The word of the day is idle. Covid getting around. Cut our hair. Latin Study at 4\. Took a nap. Revenge of the Sith. Holden, Jasper and Kiesse. Aeneas and Dido much? Jedis get no bitches. Practiced certamen with the intermediates. Grabbed dinner with Jasper. Kinda bummed that we got kicked out of History Club. Bad look. Catch up on assignments. Get out to run tonight. SLT tomorrow? Nearly 2 hours of Certamen today? Led Jasper back to Browning. Went to drop off a couple thing for Will Park at the Health Center. Easy run. Pulled 10 ups. Connect with Family. See how Chloe’s doing. Look forward to Ultimate Frisbee tomorrow. Pursue happiness. Think we’ll just ask Jacqueline to hang out tomorrow at the OMA meeting.
