Had breakfast with Alex Fan. Small small school. Plans to go hard on Thyestes. Fabula crepidata, Latin tragedies with Greeks. To be purified of the bloodguilt. Had lunch at Bart with Bill. Worked on our hum essay during galaxies. Bunraku puppetry—the servant-gods of theater. Made and manipulated a puppet with Emberlynn and Kai. Had dinner at Cathey with Isa and Phoebe. Walked back to ihouse with Simon and slept. Make a wellness appointment. Do math HW. Call wellness tomorrow and make an appointment. Be careful when doing our math. Finish Gradarius, do gradescope in the morning.

*Unchanging except for the barely perceptible smoothing and roughening tides of breath imparted to his abandoned frame by the puppeteer, who, with the humility and absolute absorption of a stabat mater, devoted every atom of his attention through out those hours to maintaining the tenuous thread of the dying man’s illusionary life—* Eve Sedgewick
