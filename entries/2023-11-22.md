Finish our stats homework. Overcast skies. Showered to reset. Put our papers on medium because we were bored. Arhon called. Build our own camera rig. Have to get out of our bed. Watch Idiocracy. Went out for a 2 miler. Socrates and Jesus Christ—the two guys who knew light.

Snippet: A designation for the self: Witty, learned, erudite, but rough, rugged, dogged—and edgy. Soft spoken, euphemistic, employing frequent catachresis. We take photos with an eye to people. We write from the personal, as one is entangled with the metaphysical. We look to God, we live devoutly. We are a solitary light traveling north to Maine. 

Came back home to spend time with Mom but maybe distance is intensified by proximity. Use our breaks to get out there and do cool things. Winter break planning. Got to go backpacking. 

To take pictures of the eyes, because age will devastate you.   
The cinematography in that 80s monkey king show.
