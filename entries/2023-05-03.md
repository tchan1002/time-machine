Woke up at 7:00. Went to our poli-sci lecture. The future insured. Tolstoy, be prolific. Ur-Examples on TV Tropes. Kingdom of Heaven, the Knight’s Oath. Napped on the A level. Read Tolstoy’s letter to a non-commissioned officer. Visited the OI. The descent of Ishtar into the Netherworld. Tomb diagrams. Talked to Nicole. Museum security. Grabbed some food at Hutch. Ran into Elijah. Stopped by a martial arts demonstration, gis on the quad. The indomitable human spirit. Lion dancing. Lumen Christi fellows. Dune Part II. Watched Hacksaw ridge. 

Summer nights in Hong Kong we fell asleep on couches.  
Dark they were, and Golden Eyed, Ray Bradbury.   
Conan the Bacterium’s fossilized remains on Mars.  
Crystallization of moments, as we inch towards death, towards biological failure.
