Woke up and submitted our math HW. Take today easy. Finish Titus Andronicus. Got up and ate at Woodlawn. Hung out with Richard and Isabella in the Homeroom, then the third floor lounge. Called Holden. Responded to the Exonian about quotes for Clarkâ€™s senior of the week article. Had jumbo wings. Read about Octopuses. Caught up with Mikey. Swam, and glad we swam. Fueled up on fourth meal. Ali called us a lyft home.
