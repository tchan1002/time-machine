Blizzy. Low droning. Took a lyft out to Gleacher. CB. Tom Yum at Snail. Went back and knocked out some drawings for Nowhere. Out to Happy Lamb. Took the 55 and 8 to Bridgeport. Sirens of Titan. Called Aboo briefly. First to arrive besides Vanessa's family. Her dad told us that he thought we'd have one eye. Sat with Peter, Surya, Lillian, and Olivia. Florals. Lyfted back. En route home, Chloe called with news that she got her Goldman offer. Stopped by Clancy's. Watched Richard play chess. There goes two years. Not bad.

Time for us to work too.

Get one or two more pairs of pants. 
It's the little details.
