Day 34  
The slow fan as we left home in the morning. Delivered bags at Hoi Tun Estate. Met David from Shanghai. Went back home. Read Murakami on the train. Slept. Watched the Bear. FX. Called Ryan on the balcony. Listened to Montell Fish. Slept. 

The Sun also Rises. Boxing in Thailand  
Writing as an extension of the writer   
A second wave of mass migration out of Hong Kong.  
Memory will lie with the diaspora.
