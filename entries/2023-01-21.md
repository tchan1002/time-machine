Slept at 4:30, woke up at 6:40. Out of a wong-kar-wai movie. Walked our friend back to Woodlawn. Ran into Henry on the way to the Metra station. Train stations and hazy early mornings. The Palmer hotel. Staffed at the Great Chicago Fire. A muffin for breakfast. Wasn’t feeling well. Freaking out. Called Sophia. Ryan called us a lyft back. Took a long nap. Had a chicken katsu down at Tiffins with Clancy. Talked to Sophia. The sex lives of college girls in the third floor lounge. Sent Stephen another email. Watched the Menu with Giancarlo, Seth, Sean and Ryan. 

“We are but a frightened nanosecond”—the Menu.  
Put some love into that cheeseburger.

Think, no… *know* now that we're conservative*.* Not religious but with the stereotypically religious sex-ed upbringing*.* Think Gabby really hurt us.
