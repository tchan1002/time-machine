**Day 96**  
Did our laundry. Went with Manar to lunch. Joined Dacia and Iris and talked architecture. On our way back, we met Manny walking a shih tzu. Told him our “shit zoo” joke. Met Lucy outside the Seminary Co-op and walked up to her apartment. Stopped by Target to grab a couple snacks (cuties, corn chips and guac, peach juice) before heading to the point. Chip and dipped. Moran joined us. Tossed a football around with some people we met. Cleaned up and recharged at Lucy’s. Took the red line up to North/Clybourn. The northside is a different city. Mini-fountains outside the Apple Store. Walked past Steppenwolf. Picked up our picnic basket from Leslie. Took the 8 bus down to Randolph street. Hung out at Taste of Randolph with Dacia and Iris. Live music\! Took the green line back to campus. Extra shaky. Ended up lyfting back after we went the wrong way west to Halsted. 

*What are we doing?* No doubt, refocus, trudge forwards.  
We are here to execute the intelligent plan of the universe  
to make good on the promises of our forefathers

Stranger \#5: Met Cole in the laundry room who was reading a book titled “Why Buddhism is True”. He told us he had gotten into meditation after reading another book about happiness. The book described three methods to increase one’s happiness: cognitive therapy, drugs, and meditation.
