Verdigris. Make use of time today. Coleridge. Kubla Khan. Read stardust. Save benadryl for event night. Almost missed health. Have to pull it together. Imperium sine fine. Forensic from forum. A proto-indo-european root of knowing, γιγνώσκω, gnosco. The brothers Grimm, your amatuer linguists. Vacuumed our flour. Felt good. The book of symbols. Ask if we can get back by eight. Dinner with McLaughlin. McLaughlin drove us down to Massachusetts, to Crave. Got burgers in Amesbury. Played some chess. Visited McLaughlin’s apartment. Sat for a bit outside agora with Jacqueline, facing the JSmith quad. Mad Cow Disease. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy. Did strides, something about a blue frog. Showed up to the Extemporaneous Essay contest. Shame that we butchered it. Think we’ll rest for a bit.
