Pick up laundry. Go to breakfast. Read Rushdie. Tater tots. A retelling of the epic of Gilgamesh and the apotheosis of Gautama. For dust you are, and to dust you shall return. Wes’ birthday on Friday. A Kakuen. Toni Morrison and the Aeneid. The significance of ants. Feeling a bit tired. Take a nap. Nero the Dimetrodon. Zormath’s eye and Ptolmac’s palm. Went to Fac Proc. Take a nap when we’re back home. Colours in description. Classics dinner tonight. Go out for Ice cream tomorrow. Uploaded our Chicago ID photo. Check when the housing application opens for us. Photo approved. Went over to Classics dinner. Big Trace. A humorous incident involving a bottle opener. Tearing up? No, a mix of allergies, the mood, and the prior consumption of a bubbled beverage. Came back and found Jacqueline in the music building. Went for a walk. Climbed the fence on the baseball field. Rounders. The unlikely coincidence of a tangerine named Toby. To the promised land with Mikey. Tried to go out for a run but wasn’t feeling it. Abstain from fizzy drinks. Advisory dinner tomorrow. Constrained writing techniques.

Is that what a summer night is? When the stars encircle the blue night on the horizon at the end of the road?
