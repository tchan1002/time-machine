**Day 99**  
Chloe called. Grabbed breakfast and cried for lost youth. Was raining out. Compiled our coolcats into eggs (reflections). Found an efficient rhythm to stocking rooms. We’re going to the RNC\! Dinner at 6:00. Nap and clean up our room between now and then. They Might Be Giants with Moran on Tuesday? Read *The Design of Everyday Things*. Had dinner at Luke’s. Almost didn’t but went 4 miles with Juliana. 

Memento: Art is not risky. Not doing art is risky. Look into cognitive science for design. Quit paradoxical living—polisci is an ill compromise.

This is what I think of us, that we are beams of light traversing the vast nothingness. Occasionally intersecting, never quite parallel.

End of Spring/Guadalajara (Third of May/Odaigahara). RNC historic summer.
