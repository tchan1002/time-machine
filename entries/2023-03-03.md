Sylvia Plath’s tale of a tub. Spring songs. Elevated our legs above a bed of pillows. Got dressed and walked to Woodlawn. Zone in and write. Met with Dan Moore over zoom. Snowing hard now. The sweet smell of paper. D-Hall marathon. Moved to Cathey. Sat in the fishbowl. Called Andrew out on the steps of BJ. Walked through the quad, the trees lit up like stars above our head. Listened to Tae sing acapella in Hutch.

Prompt: Two strangers, a diner, a snowstorm. 

Snippet: Laid on the steps of BJ and talked to Andrew about apocalypse. The song by Cigarettes After Sex, and the end scene of Flight Club. Writing here, truth be told, feels often like scrawling on the walls of some fallout shelter. 

Doctrine: On writing. In the age of telepathy, perhaps writing will seem a barbaric way of sharing our consciousness. As photography changed the paradigms of painting, we might find writing’s value not in the transparency of its lens but the translucence of its veil. 

Snippet: On last stands. What moves people to take on causes bound to fail? Did they know that dying would make them immortal?

Song: Montezuma by Fleet Foxes.
