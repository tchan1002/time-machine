Woke up at 8. Midterm done. Bart lunch. Lena. Met Bennett, who had spent his summer at Twin Oaks, an intentional community in Virginia. Said he ran into Lucas KB there. Ordered four seasons dumplings at the CLI office. Hallowed grounds. Kevin offered us an Iced Chai on the house. Sat downstairs with Claire and submitted our maroon articles to copy. Sun peaking. Letters to Milena. Letters from Milena. Picked up dumplings for Launch. Wopo practice. Lipton tea.

Git git git git make.
Embrace the herd.
9 years will fly by in 9 days.
And the city will change outside of our window.

Any things/anyone waiting on us?

Too many people create stuff that we don't need. Have appreciation from others be the little validation to ensure we're on the right track.
