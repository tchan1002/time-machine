Day 21  
Woke up around 8:00. Put on our belt, took the train back to To Kwa Wan. Had dim sum with Aboo and Gonggong. Came back and slept. New AMTA case came out a couple days ago. Thinking about it, we do miss mock trial. *The Hong Kong Porcupine Rehabilitation Association.* We gotta stay moving. Need a little Rocky moment. Went out to Nam Cheong. Went back home. Ate. Bittermelon soup.

A 5 foot *Varanus salvator* escaped the Hong Kong zoo.  
June 1st, we wrote to “stress the organism, to exhaustion.” We did.
