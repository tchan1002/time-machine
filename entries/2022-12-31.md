Day 2  
Woke up to morning mist. Last day of the year. Took a long nap. Talked to Indigo. Pack tonight. Things are going to get busy when we get to Chicago. See what tomorrow brings. Kahlil Gibranâ€™s *The Astronomer*. To bare our hearts under the stars. Worked on our Pareto app. The parochial mind cannot comprehend pizza box sushi. Arrested Development. 

Every journey of a postcard maps the lines of our reality.
