Woke up. Had breakfast at Baker. Went to Hum. *Sans-souci*. Talked to Bill about Midsommar. Took the metra on 57th. Picked up our new mac. The carbide and carbon building. Ferris Bueller. Took the metra back to school. Went to our TAPs class. Ate at Cathey with Phoebe and Isabella. Took a lyft back. Migrated to our new mac. Get back to writing. Take good care of our mac.

Snippet: *Si tus ojos fueran el cielo, y tu boca el mar, quisiera ser el atardecer para besarte cada d√≠a.*

Podcast: Human interest. Like the murals on the metra station by 57th.
