Day 78  
Fourth of July. Had toast for breakfast. Compile movie recs. Cook lunch at 12:30. Meeting with Clark tonight at 8:15. Fried pickles. Noodles and fish paste for dinner. Put in some romaine hearts. Celery with ground meat. Phantom islands. Cell systems. Private intelligence. Done with the LoRs in two and a half hours. Over-easy eggs. Roman hearts for lunch. Make a blooming onion. Cunctus unctus. Went for a walk with Clark. Went down by the track to look at fireflies. The bluest flower. Bluets by Maggie Nelson. On communicating matters of perception. How does one explain to another that they never saw the stars growing up? Breasts and eggs. Read so we can read more. Return to knowledge and goodness. @doodleskelly. Our youth, we’ll return someday. Botulus. The Bibliotheca. Heracles Engonasin. Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Presumption of innocence. Looking at you on my silly little screen. We’ve got some spending money. Compose an anthology, like we’ve always wanted to. Dermotaxi.  
   
PL07: stories we tell. Billboards. Who am I to the world?
