Day 24  
Tried out VR headsets on the elderly at Wong Tai Sin. Shawn. Had mushroom cream spaghetti for lunch. Grinded on our video at work. *When Can I See You Again?*  Left work with Olger. Ate around Central. Followed Olger to Mong Kok. Had softserve. Went to Olgerâ€™s place, where he lent us some shorts. Houston Rockets. Played ball with randos. Sweat drenched. Walked back home via Sheung Shing Road. Kowloon Tong. Cool out. Showered when we got home. Went on a midnight nostalgia trip after seeing a clip of us at elm. Caught up with Amber. 

We desired the apotheosis of the chamber.   
Dogged, got that dog in him. Hunger is perceptible.
