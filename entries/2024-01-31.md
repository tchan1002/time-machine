Showered. Grabbed lunch with Francisco, Ryan, and Jillian. Sent our resume in on Handshake for the Polsky resume book. Had soup at Baker with Ellie. Warm apple cider at the HRL staff meeting always hits. Cristi recommended us *Tender is the Flesh* (re. Rick and Morty pasta). Grabbed fourth meal with Lola. The stars\! *And the gravel trains get stuck and go back.*
