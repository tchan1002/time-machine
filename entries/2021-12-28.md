Ate pasta. Went over today. Smashed a lid. Went out for a recovery. Still sore but feeling better. No foot pain. Read and listen to music. Talk to friends. Find a list of trigonometric equivalencies and memorize them. Walk through Khan Academy calculus. Autos Didaktikos. Hair seems to be growing back. 1000 mile year? Make eggs for breakfast. Calling aboo tomorrow. Wild Grass. Running with bricks? Magda Commander.
