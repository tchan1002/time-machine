Day 8  
Went down to New Haven and had Thai food with mom. Went to our appointment. Got the flu vaccine and the covid booster. Picked up our vans from DSW. Mind’s been barren the past couple days, but we’re in a good place for college. Make running a priority for tomorrow. Be in the business of making memories. Called Amber again. Caught us in a happy moment.
