Went over to BPSB. Chris registered our fingerprints. The left hand in case we lose our right. Bartlett. Muffin wrappers, butterfly wings. Ate with Chloe Eng. Read Berto's tribute to his friend. Inland Empires. Aeneas and the deer. *Tremulis*. Called Katy about Nowhere. Interviewed Will and Eitan for [[Who's On?]]. Ex Lib was playing the Lumineers. Published our Maroon puppet articles. Jacques the Party Scientist.

[[Nowhere Collective]]:
Over the weekend, Katy organized a successful scavenging session where she brought makers to pickup materials that her friend Nathan needed gone. 
We should have been thinking about how people offload materials.
See facebook marketplace: people just need stuff gone.
That's the most urgent need to build around. That's the entry point into the material lifecycle.

Chris told us about a Reynold's black room that the university had furnished for a faculty spouse back in the 70s. The room was painted black head to toe. The inhabitant did not appreciate when the incandescent light made streaks on the walls. She wanted pure black.
