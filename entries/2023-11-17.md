Woke up. Showered. Picked up our laundry. Packed. Talked with Christina about Ted during our FA class. Sadiq called. Good convos on our journey home. Carpool Christina got us to talk to a stranger on the plane. Met an Andrew Bridy from Syracus, who taught math at Yale and now works at Google. Back home in Connecticut. *How much the camera is about access*. Kinda want to just watch movies and sleep. Submitted our fundamentals application. 

I think of God everyday now. I have a terrible time staying here.
