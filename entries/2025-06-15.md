Red-eye flight to Jakarta. Coast of China, through the Taiwan strait, then over the Phillipines. South China sea, south of the equator. Felt nervous if not slightly nauseous. Landed in the wee hours of the morning, Gojek to Emporer Pluit. Pluit means road. Hotel breakfast. Snakefruit, Sakalâ€”pretty nutty. Liked the chicken broth. Grabbed a massage. Deep tissue. Visited Gambir and Pasar Senen Stasiuns. Horrific urban planning, but the people are so helpful. A security guard helped us call our gojek, a passerby pointed us towards customer service. Genuinely thought we were going to pass out at Pasar Senen. Fell dead asleep when we got back at 4. Slept for the rest of the day.
