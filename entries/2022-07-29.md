Book four best book. King Iarbas. Our Catullus class with Kiesse. Op Samuels. The Purple and Gold. Suited up for the Farewell Dance. Caspar Bailey and his cologne. Dancing Queen at Seventeen. Our last highschool dance? Was a rager. Lit night, but had to catch some sleep for our early flight tomorrow. Make a cool cat post.
