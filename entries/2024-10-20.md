Steve Jobs. Beat sloth, went down to the Invisible Institute for Maroon All-eds. Teenage Dirtbag by Wheatus. Daniel Babnigg handed us the HRL duty bag. Signed Celina into North to work on Psych. Went down to Ida for our shift. Called Max Kastl. This side of paradise. Grabbed a bite in bart. Bought toothpaste. Moved to the Reynolds courtyard. Shame we haven't touched our camera in a month. Sat outside and read. Grabbed dinner at Baker. 

Two big fish to fry this week

Fight fragmentation of the mind
"Junkyard dog or alley cats"
"Money talks and bullshit walks" Max Kastl

re: the Penguin, the small time gangster Rex Calabres,  who sent you a doctor when you were sick and fronted your rent when you were short. Be like an Amm Taha, know things about the people around us. So that we know their names, their wants and dislikes. We want to be a man like thatâ€”well-loved. 

Nostalgia for fall at home. Coming back from a run. Jump in the shower, and the cold sheds. Come out, feet on the carpet. Put on night clothes, and we sit downstairs, make tea and have bread. 

We miss being really really happy.
