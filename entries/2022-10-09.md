Woke up and showered. Composed our Classics close reading. First Mock practice. Our keycard restored. Team C3PO. Samâ€™s birthday. Late lunch at Bart. Walked around the Reg. Settled in some corner of Reynolds. Wrote up our Iliad observations. Took a nap in Reynolds. Picked up a copy of the South Side Weekly on our way out. Went to Woodlawn for dinner. House Council. Make Thompson headbands a reality. Prep for Sliced Bread Tomorrow. Hung out downstairs with Devin and Sergio. Tried unsuccessfully to resolve the door-wheel debate. Had jumbo wings. Pale fire.
