#### Must Do's

Went out with Chloe and Mom to go shopping in the plaza. Played with a cassette player at the Goodwill. Got ourselves a new jacket, which Chloe said looks just like our old jacket. Le Monde Gourmand's Soda Pop. Give ourselves the experience of visiting a perfumer. Ordered two shoes and two pairs of jeans from Lees to be shipped to Chicago. Decided on a population for our interview guide, fill that out tomorrow and code ITYSM so that we can show Raghu something on Friday. Went out on a run. Cold. Down to the track. Cleared our head and wrote down plans for the [[Hum Lab]]. [Black Friday](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/27/business/black-friday-shopping-cyber-monday.html) could be supple ground for our second observation. Wonder if the reselling-regifting market booms after every holiday season as a result of overpurchase.
