Evangelion. Time for a cool cat. Grabbed breakfast at Baker. Went to our micro lecture. Do homework so that we have time this week. Napped. Submitted one version of our prereg. Watch Almost Famous. *Twiddle thy thumbs.* Sat down with Alex and Leah at Hutch. Scoped out Euphony. Finished our artist feature guide. Psyops? Walked for the moda model casting callâ€”broke down and giggled. Good fourth meal with Thomas. Nice long talk with Vanessa and Jackie into the night. Booker T. Washington apologists. Slept. 

An image is the cross section of memory.   
In Macau with Olger, how important it is just to think that you can win.   
Be so keen that the past is a prison, not for one to dwell.   
You shall go and break bread with strangers.

Thoughts for Sliced Bread via Euphony:  
Really like our Trophy Room, the projector is goated  
Do intros/icebreakers, have conversational norms.   
Closing activity to tie things together.
