Salvage for micro. The land is one incessant droning. Millennium Mambo. Indie authors, Calvino. Have to stop falling into microsleep during religion. Walked back to North. Napped and dreamt a very long dream. Texted Chloe. Wish sometimes that we went to the same college. Grabbed a quick bite at Baker. Cut our hair and showered. Sent birthday messages to our friends. Submitted our FA homework. Housekeeping matters. Be well.

Get ahead of work this week. Weâ€™re going home this Monday. Use Thanksgiving to reset.   
Do what Olivia Rae does. Talk to people, get leads for summer plans. Get out there\!
