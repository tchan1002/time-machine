Fog, the edges of the world hidden. The Book of Job. Ran into Robert. Got a muffin at Harper. Settled in one of the Stuart cubicles. Speedran our micro pset. Lucy came and sat down with us for a bit. Escaped, moved to Bartlett. Cream of rice chicken soup. Went back and took a nap. Sanket Bhasin. A vitamin-painkiller analogy, sell painkillers\! Think politics, amass and mobilize. Say to ourselves we’ll never leave the room. Made midnight pasta. Shaved cheddar. Stayed up with Vanessa. Matilda. The Bug Collector.

CNVC: Start early. Read the startup manual like a bible. Go out there and do stuff. Get a capable team together. Dogshit optimist. Lean into what we’re good at. Use this summer. Keep talking to people from this class. Analogs.

Vexation kills the fool.
