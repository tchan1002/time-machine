Deleted discord yesterday to take our minds off [[Papam]] for the rest of the weekend. Alas, Ada Palmer pulled us back in. Emergency switch to Valentino Borgias. *You take the man out of the pope not the pope out the man.*

Spent the day on [[Papam]] planning in Kublai's war roomâ€”i.e RA study. Pretty much a fever dream?

The alfredo moser plastic day lamp. A bottle of water imbued with sunlight to light up homes in the dark.
