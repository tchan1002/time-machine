Facilis Descensus Averno. Nosa and Dante. Got destroyed somewhat. At least we got Seneca the Younger. Charlie gave us a piggy back ride. Emma Filthy. Visited Unger’s ancestral home. The lore. Espresso shots. Went to Szech with Kirtland. Five nights at Freddy’s. Walked around the river with Kiesse, Jaqueline, Lara, Joy, Oscair, Harry and Antar. An oath of rocks. The shadow of a horse. Rest for red eyes. Show up to dramat tomorrow.
