Slow day. Chloe’s birthday in two. Watched Hellboy. Got out of bed. Took pictures of Yuto near Bond. Had a burger at Cathey with Ellie and Corinne. Mayday, Midsommar. Went to authoritarian regimes. Pop quiz—good thing we showed up to class. Grabbed food at Woodlawn with Niko and his friends. Hopped on a bus that went nowhere. Walked back to North. Need to R2A. Impending cicadapocalypse. Fries at fourth meal. Robert and Sequoia. Dropped by Scav. Familiar faces from IHouse. Collective effervescence.

Summer, let the cicadas rouse our souls.    
Skin-shed, externalize our internal convictions.
