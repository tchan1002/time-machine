**Day 27**  
Sweltering heat. Out of New Orleans. Day on the train. Lake Pontchartrain. Crossed most of the South, though we just slept and watched TV. Swamp and forest. Met Felicia from Liberia. Turned our laptop screen so we could watch *Into the Badlands* together. Brief stop in Atlanta. Walked out on the platform. Half a dozen DEA agents searched a manâ€™s bag.
