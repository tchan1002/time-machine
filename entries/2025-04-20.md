#### Must Do's

Baby goats, wayward eyes, boxed pupils, truly not of the same kind. Spent the day in real fugue. A weakness in our limbsâ€”a little less control than we would have liked. Aeneas trembling. Ate, read, and slept. Stop rubbing our eyes. Temple of the golden pavilion. Called dad briefly. Spicy chicken noodles. Watched the White Tiger.

The first act of independence is picking one's own clothes.
Cancel extraneous appointments tomorrow. Catch up for real.
In search of great salt flats.
