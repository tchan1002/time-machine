**Day 100**  
Woke up at 7:00. Stocked rooms with linens. Shift has us spent. Wrote a script for our ethan uncurated parody. Napped till 4:30. Grabbed a quick bite at woodlawn. Lyfted to the point. Hung out with Julia. Swam for a bit. Fireflies. Caught the fireworks at Navy Pier, no sound though. Talked Latin and FNAF. Walked back to South, changed into some running shoes and went downstairs. A solid 2-miler recovery. Showered. 

Showers and runs let us think\! Two weeks into the summer: are we on a good pace? Things can change in a day. Have to chart our end goals. We want to build a personal brand.
