**Day 45**  
Woke up early in the morning. Took the green line to Ashland for a conference on chemicals. Many people from the Bay. *F11 and be there.* Felt pretty dizzy (maybe lack of water, maybe lack of sleep). Went back home. L1 Arts Accelerator. Hit the couch and crashed. Skated down to South. Dinner with Bertie at Medici. Called Bai. House to ourselves kind of sitch. Badlands, South Dakota.

Here’s something we’ve been thinking about for a while now—does the evil lie in money being a bad representation of value? or does the evil lie in *our* misplaced values as a society?
