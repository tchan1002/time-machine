Woke up. Called Aboo. Grabbed a bart breakfast. Rabo Karabekian, the Temptation of St Anthony. Mythos of the self. Got the snowball gig\! Met up with Sergio. Took his pictures; copied the poses in hutch. Did Adama and Nicole, too. Went by the Fire Escape film premiere. Free merch and salmon croutons. Saw ourselves on the big screen. Racer Clarence. A really good convo with Luke Delaney’s parents. Saturday night meal swipe—Noodles Etc. has always been good to us. Stumbled into Vanessa’s band playing at Mandel hall. Walked to the 56th metra station; ran into Avaril, Billy and Anna. Arrived at the palmer house. Left with Ryan to Steppenwolf. The immortal jellyfish girl. Famished. Lyfted back to the Hyde Park McDonalds. Downed nuggets and a spicy chicken sandwich. Cleaned up in a South bathroom. Went to the Fire Escape afterparty. Sprite. What a good time, get to know Finn. Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
