Day 80  
The rhythm of the city, participating in rush hour. Movement of demographics, uptown to downtown. Cars are steel beasts. Visited the Hong Kong Refugee Union. Met Adella from Uganda. Had curry brisket at the Sheung Wan market. Virtrix VR. Got congee and beef innards down at the Tai Po market with mom. Think we came through. Lock ourselves in a room and just write. Watched Suits with Chloe. The Kobayashi Maru. 

Write about the loneliest Americans, something deeply confessional about completing the arc. “A couple years ago we could not do one pullup, now we can do eight.”

Stephen McNulty’s defense of an idealist.
