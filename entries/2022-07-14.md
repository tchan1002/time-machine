Day 68  
The last day of our solitary state. Cloverfield. Look into ultra low budget spec scripts. Heinrich Lossow. NYC’s nuclear PSA. Love at the end of the world. Our little speck of dust. Met Arhon on the New Haven green. Ended up at the same restaurant. Came back and put our clothes in the laundry. Go find a library in Boston and write. We’ve got 68 days to make a difference. Romaine hearts for dinner. Simulate nanowrimo. Put our clothes in the dryer at 8:00. Thank god for Honey Citron and Ginger Tea. Alone on the history channel. Had dinner. Vacuumed the kitchen. Keep working. Project Gigachad.

“Extinction is the rule, survival is the exception” Carl Sagan. Got to learn from the best if we want to get good.
