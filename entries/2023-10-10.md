Breakfast at Baker. Greek yogurt with dried mangos. Picked up our UPass. Settled in Bart. Ate with Elijah, Rina and Jesenia. Taiwanese indie, the Chairs. Fight the grey. Went to our micro lecture. Ate with Lucy and Audrey. Had our Firebird interview at Ex Libâ€”actually really want to be part of the club now. Went to the Harper cubicles to finish our micro pset with Kaan, Yuto and Audrey. Went down to Cathey with Yuto afterwards. The Chicago Kabuki Club. IM Volleyball. Grabbed a water at fourth meal. Returned to work on Stats with Rose. Cut our hair. 

Asked Yuto if he thought it would be weird to go to an onsen with friends. 

Reduced to a hollow shell of anecdotes.   
Speak softly, be euphemistic, always alluding to animals  
this thing *parasitic,* or that thing a *worm heart*.   
*Stop jerking off, go work out.*
