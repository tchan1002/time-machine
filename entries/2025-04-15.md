Tuesday, finally slept and caught up. Past couple days of [[Papam]] have been intense. Dark circles around our eyes. Grabbed lunch with Malhar at Bart. Forwarded recommendation requests for Chicago Booth and Schwarzman to Paul and Joe. Filled out SITG forms and requested our 7k stipend for the summer—we just need a confirmation from Wismah Bahasa. Salad. Leo/lulu gave us a friendship bracelet she had made for us as Farnese.

Lunch with Malhar:
Malhar is building his paypal mafia. Compiling a list of talent on campus. Big fan of Peter Thiel, says his favourite book is Hofstader's GEB. Godel, Escher, Bach. We spoke about the knowledge economy. He told us to check out Tyler Cohen's marginal evolution.

Character and Commerce:
Turner's blot of orange—a little red buoy in the right spot can steal the show. Magic is in knowing how to create that effect through supersensory perception.
