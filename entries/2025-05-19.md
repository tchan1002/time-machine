Lest cattle doom us. Lunch with Amber. Class in the afternoon. 12 hours and more to write our Schwarzman essays. What's our story. Napped for an hour. Glizzy guzzled at fourth. Ketchup. (Bro maybe we don't get this. Nah we got this.) Slept for an hour after an all-nighter. Gotong royang, Tikkun Olam. We really ragnaroked this. Just have to write ourselves into a plausible future.
