Woke up and went downstairs for Kuvia. Walked to the point. Started snowing. Penguin huddles. Picked up breakfast and took a nap back at ihouse. Emerged from a long dream. Retrieved our phone charger and went to Greece and Rome. Sitcoms and Greek Tragedies: Critiques on Family. Had lunch with Fredric. First time at the pasta bar. Happy\! Sat down in the reg. Long weekend. Ghost plants, colorless flowers. Chicago Chinatown research. Registered for an AMTA account. Returned to ihouse. Put our clothes in the launders. Went to watch Magnolia with Clancy. A PT Anderson film. Itâ€™s raining frogs. Respect the Cock. Went to Lambda with Clancy, Sal and others. Thomas Grant. Took a lyft back. Felt profoundly sad about Gabby. 

Coolcat these two weeks.  
Is the pursuit of happiness? Do push ups. Order swim trunks.
