**Day 102**  
8:00 A.M. Natural wake. Showered. Don’t sleep with lake water. Grabbed breakfast at Woodlawn. Languished. Grabbed lunch with Rina, Who we ran into. Run up to Northwestern. Returned Ann her bowl. Settled in the Stuart cubicles for a little bit. Took pictures of ants—something about god. Reddit on the rise with OpenAI. 50 hours worked last week. 6 miler to Neutral Milk Hotel. We woke up. 

What actually are we so deeply unhappy about? We haven’t even unlocked the efficient use of 10% of our time.

Travel far, travel wide, travel a million miles in the night.  
We have the responsibility to jump. 

@feier\_restaurant advertising. UPenn reach. The wharton social media game is strong—we haven’t even tried putting ourselves up on the map.
