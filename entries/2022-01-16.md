Indigo’s birthday today. Charles and Kira’s tomorrow. Check Exeter connect every day. Ingratitude Journal. No actually make one. Make a post about Indigo. Derek Savage. Season 5\. Los Pollos Hermanos. *Mala leche*. Get back on track. Finish homework for the week. Kurt Vonnegut. In a dark dark room. Built a resume today. Applied to the program. Search for internships. Productive day. Professional growth. The Nonsense. Got Lexies from the food truck and ran into Shrayes. I’m actually so fucking dumb. Do some research and get showered. It’s all good, man. Risk assessment. Chicago to Toronto?

All my life, my dad’s told me that a man’s worth is defined by what he can do for others, the value he provides. “If you know what people want“, he tells me,”you have them.” Now multiply the wants of one person to a crowd, if you could quantitatively evaluate that, you have the world.
