Day 94  
Grilled hamburger with rice. A Japanese cover of Only You playing in the restaurant. Had three servings of salad, three servings of onion soup and two servings of rice. Acquired some new drip at Uniqlo. Came back early. Did some pushups. Ran the Norwegian Wood route from Komagome to Yotsuya. Past Iidabashi, ran by the river to Yotsuya station. Visited Suga Shrine in the rain. A particular set of stairs. Took the Yamanote line back home. Cool 7 miler, always save the day. Had a goated French toast from 7/11. 

Notes on our run:  
Roads reminiscent of Shanghai, unlike the grid and lattice of Chicago and New York. Paced by little kids on bikes on their way home back from school.
