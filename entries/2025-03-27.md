SLOTH IS SIN. Got out of bed. Met Attila over lunch at bart. Talked video productionâ€”how his video picking up made him believe it was possible. Renaissance and Ulysses, Catholic seeds. Sat in baker. Petitioned for Marx to count towards Econ. Went to Ratner and worked out Back with Angelito. Dinner with Nico. Talked through his script for *Forgive Me* and his sound design process. Pick sound pallets. In pursuit of an earworm. Sliced Bread. Corrine's back. Talked for a couple hours until 1 in the morning.

Productive trigger: sleeping head to window, and opening the window right as we get up. 

[[Who's On?]] sound palette:
- Dr. Who. 
- Rick and Morty theme. 
- Scavenger's Reign. 
- Kurzgesagt.
- Visual imagery: vhs tape insert/space ship ignition. we plop into an alien sea and swim through reeds and sponges. 

We don't want to talk about vapid things but perhaps we live too seriously. 
No new projects. We have stuff to write about.

Ulysses: Greek and Latin, Britisher and Irish, East and West. 
Stephen Dedalus' fugue state is an expression of humility.
