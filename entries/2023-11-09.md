Slept in. Felt slightly horrible most of the day. Went to our collaborative stats session. A soft reset. Picked up keys from Cristi. Went to dinner with Sliced Bread. Really good meeting. Love our projector, the circle of couches. Something in our eyes, a collective vision. Paper cutting study break was a good time. Listened to music with Thomas. *King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard*. Submitted our stats homework. Slept.

On Sliced Bread. *Really want people to feel like they have a stake in this, because they do.* 

Sliced Bread: The magazine is what the magazine eats. We have to be inclusive in community but exclusive in the submissions that we take. Quality assurance.
