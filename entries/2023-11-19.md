Caught up with Smaiyl via text. Took the nifty fifty on a test drive. Went out with our penny board. Met a kid named Ryan, who showed us some one-handed bike riding. Talked fortnite and world events. The sky made us go grab our camera. A family of crows in the next condo over. Sherard in 186\. Had hotpot with the fam. Holden called. Went out for a 3 miler. Realized we didnâ€™t bring our camera battery charger. No more @tobes\_photog this break. 

Warped perspective. Get a fisheye lens.  
Multi-self portraiture. Get a tripod.
