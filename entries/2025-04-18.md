Truly warm out. Up in the 70s. Quad and point season. Lunch call with Will Park about [[Big Indo]]. Water street books. Called Paul Cavalieri. *Schlept.* Filled out entries for the past couple of days. Editing Colin's episode for publishing. Run and do pushup-failure. Sleep, eat well, dress well. Dinner. Pushed out Colin's episode.

Call mom, dad, aboo, chloe.

Hear the cherry blossoms are blooming in Jackson park. Grab our camera and go look at them tomorrow. That'll be a nice saturday.

Be less tired so that we may give more concise statements.
Grinding hard over nothing vs grinding hard over everything.

Notes with Will Park:
Medici—Patronage—feudal relationships. Subversion can just be making the non-obvious obvious. Marx. Can we do something with de-objectification, pulling the human back out of objects? "Realizing the human API." Think of the grooves that tell you a vase was made by a set of human hands. If not a tag, can it appear like a patch on a shirt, or an imprint in the material? Subtle but tactile, inseparable from the material just as human labor is. See Berlin's The Human Touch. Artisans tailoring shirts with fluorescent dyed hands so that the final product under UV light is so clearly a culmination of people. Think time, lineage, imprints, chrysalis. Maybe bacteria on a petri dish. The microbiome in your gut? All kinds of fingerprints. [[Substack]]
