Day 92  
Woke up. Grabbed Dim Sum with Aboo and 公公. Took the bus to 大埔 for a prepaid sim card. Published a coolcat on our way there. Lychee and Mangosteen. Homegoing travelogues. Took a poll of who’s in Hong Kong this summer. Connecticut and the tristate area resembling the planet Arrakis. Dropped mom off at 元朗. Had dinner at 大家樂. What’s happening in New York? Thunderstorms for the next week. Did push ups until our arms were sore. Eat well, eggs and protein.
