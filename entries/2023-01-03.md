Had breakfast with Shikai. Marbled vegetarian bacon? Chandra’s taking galaxies with us. Caught up with Fredric in Calc. Morphonym Exercise \#27. Had lunch in Baker. Fireworks in Woodlawn, Armenian nationalist-extremists. Made our soccer deposit at Ratner. Settled in a corner of the Reg. Mock tonight. Music maps, the Lumineers. Going against the A-Team on Thursday, bring our A game. Bubbaloo, Mexican Bubblegum. Grabbed a takeout box before Mock. Yoke Lore. Walked back to IHouse with Elijah. Hung out with Clancy in Sal’s room. Mitchell Handsome. Don’t hurt ourselves over Gabby. 

Restore R2A, institute a habit tracker.
