- [x] Monday letter for papam
- [x] Extra credit stuff for Papam

Wake up and go! Pope class out on the lawn. Back home. Rest. Write essays, apply to stuff. Osaka's metabolism, bio-concrete fusion. Called Mom and Dad, not happy with us. Need to advance Indonesia. Took a break. Grabbed our copy of Ulysses and went down to Baker to read. The murder of Gonzago. Three cups of English Breakfast and 2 scoops of peppermint later. Pater, filii, et spiritu sancti. Fight the bard. Shakespeare loved Italy. Ulysses x 1492 x Marx. 

We have not yet left the realm of theory. 

Should the capitalist not be rewarded for his innovation? Is not capitalism particularly productive? Take a closer look at innovation. Marx x 1492.

The first sign of the death of empire was the disappearance of papyrus. Books started being made of vellum, which made books more expensive than houses. Lorenzo de Medici engaged in a multi-generational project with Poliziano. A library of the Greeks and Romans, so that not he but his sons will have the knowledge of a bygone era. It was this investment even in the darkest timesâ€”that's how much knowledge was worth. 

Parable. We live in rooms, adjoining cells with just a window between us. Some rooms have light, some rooms do not. We can only open windows to be illuminated.
