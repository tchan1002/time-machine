Grabbed chicken soup at Bartlett. Coolcatted. Met Ryan on the quad. Took the metra up to millennium station. Ate at Canes. Walked along lake shore drive. Sears tower. Went up to the Lincoln zoo. Reptile house. Saw some red faced macaques grooming each other. Prestack teams came out—a weird feeling to not be doing mock anymore. Took the metra back to 57th. Had vermicelli at Hutch. What’s going on with Israel? Made pasta with Ryan. Elysium. 

Be not afraid to set out from the flock, be egregious.
