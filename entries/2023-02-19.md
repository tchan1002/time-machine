Called JF when we woke up at 8:00. Ran into Olivia Rae on the way to Bart. Sat down with Hunter. *Pass the 8 ball game back.* Walked to Cathey. Sat down with Richard and met Isabella. *The impossible dream.* Met with Ryan. Back to the reg stacks. R2R2A. Submitted our quick writing. Golden hour. Travelled the waste land—the fisher king. Had two bowls of beef chili at Bart before going back home. Felt profoundly sad. People aren’t very good at communicating. Stopped by Sophia’s. Daydream Believer. Showered. Go swim tomorrow morning. Damn, broke our laptop.

Memento: Called JF today. Asked him if there were kids our age he could talk to. Yes, he said, but they didn’t share the same sense of *urgency* about life. Perhaps this was what we had lost. *It's about being principled, always knowing what you’re doing and who you’re doing it for.* Thomas Wang told him some time ago.
