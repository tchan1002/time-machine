#### Must Do's
- [x] write coolcat
- [x] move into ibu dian's

Woke up a little late. Played a bit of Bob Dylan on our walk to class. Desolation Row. Finished Buku 1A in the morning. Took our test. Met Jati, an Indonesian Aussie. Had a Kwetiau Goreng at Hari Hari. Didn't bring cash so Jati covered for usâ€”said he skates too. Went back to the kos. Packed up. Had Suburbans. Left for Ibu Dian's. Bapak Prijo showed us his international mask collection. Mbak Fika came over. Sudah jalannya. "It is fated." Ibu Dian's place is nice but our kos was lowkey not bad at all. Scent makes a place comfortable.

Our skin feels healed.
Our digestion could be better.
Microbiome gut health.
