Spent the day out with Dad at the tailor's. Got our photo sorted for Schwarzman. Told our dad the St. Francis story over lunch. Our hair will grow out. Our body will fill. We just keep clean our mind. Lola by the Kinks. Submitted our Schwarzman stuff. Music roused us back a little. Hike up the mount.

Come on get up man get up get up. Fast tomorrow, all this food is weighing us down. Do not forego the mind-world link. Substack needs to be pushed out—1 who's on episode followed by 1 article of our own. Don't blame the world for the wealth it has given us—many more are poor souls.
