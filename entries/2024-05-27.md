**Day 116**  
Aboo called us. Made lunch. Went down to South to pick up mags from Courtney. Camped out in a Cobb room. A wild sense of nostalgia for mock practices our first year. Took pictures for Vikram and mock seniors. Sent Henry back his pictures. Caught up with Courtney. Thunderstorms in the distance. Hang the DJ. Caved, made food, and ate. 

Clean up our room tonight \+ run. Call Aboo.
