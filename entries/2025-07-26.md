Lazy morning. Slept in. USINDO activities. Awais wants susu. Hopped to a mall to watch Superman. Ice scene was cool. Foreign policy implications of a soft international box office launch? Superman's the spirit of America, Lex is the technocrat selling the country out, Jahanpur is Ukraine. Had a tofu snack at the downstairs supermarket. Celebrated Dian's birthday with a cake. The candle wax fast-dripping. Dozed off on the ride back home with Aurora. Quick dinner with the fam. Met Nannette—Ibu Dian's niece. Fam's night out on Malioboro. Hamza batik, we should make our way back here for oleh oleh. Malio gelato—tempat bagus. Had orange peel cheesecake and tiramisu. Took an andong all the way home to kotagede. The whole way back we were looking at the horse's musculature and imagine what it must like to gallop.

Because Jogja's wage is second-lowest in all of Java, the working age people leave to work elsewhere, leaving a city of retirees and students. As a result, the city is defined by its santai, and clashing cultures between contemporary and traditional. Cafes vs warungs. (Consider this for our video: Jati + Dalang)

Ibu Dian's Berkebaya Day was gotong royong. A self made effort. Wayang kulit is a masculine tradition.
