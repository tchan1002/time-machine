Oatmeal for breakfast. Involved Interviewing. Had lunch at Bartlett. Stopped by the CCRF fair.   
Digital ethnographies? All about lily chou chou came up. Moved to Stuart. Did our readings behind the desk. Phoebe dropped by for a little bit. Flu shot on the quad. The Lives of Others. Think hard about ethnographies. Malinowski’s participant observation. Always a sea-change. Dinner. Went to Wopo. Was nice to feel our body sore. Ran into Alec coming back into North. Checked out his room before hanging out in ours. These past days have been nice and full. We must be less edgy.

The chef rolls out a cloth covered cage and it’s clear something’s banging in there. The cloth comes off and it's a monkey with its head fixed immobile, arms flailing about. The chef scalps the monkey and feeds the guests live monkey brains.

So yes, Coetzee, the lives of animals. 4 days pescatarian.
