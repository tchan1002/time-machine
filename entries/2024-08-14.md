**Day 39**  
Sleep last night was a little rough. Woke up in Sacramento. Above the bay. Will Park’s up. Wrapped around the water. Said bye to Margot. Will Park picked us up in his Gray Nissan Altima. Breakfast in Pacific Heights, Sweet Maple. Talked magazines. Hung out in Golden Gate park. It’s building a tribe—Sliced Bread is a short term realization of amigo. Regained confidence about our project. Ran into buildspace people. Hung out on Ocean Beach. Indonesian smoking cartridge. Touched the pacific—ran into the pacific. Tasted the salt and said *thalassa, thalassa.* Little wet. Will Park showed us his favourite taqueria in the city. Showered. Sent back our DNC confidentiality agreement. Got all of our classes for fall. Went out to meet with Bango and his brother Gabe. 7 miles. Up Kearney, then Columbus, then all the way along the water past cressy field to the Golden Gate Bridge. View of the city. Pink fog coming over the pacific: that’s the edge of the world. *Sun is down, freezing cold*. Old driver drove us back. We’re in love with this city. Said we will one day live here. Made noodles for dinner in the hostel. Met Adam from Sydney and Giovanni from Rome. 

Did not expect to get sunburnt in San Francisco. 

Will Park showed us some of his 11mm photography in Indonesia. So wide it draws you in. As they say, if the picture isn't good it's because you’re not close enough. 

Here are tribes—runners, skaters, Muslims, the *ummah.*
