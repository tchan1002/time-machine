#### Must Do's
- [x] Call Aboo
- [x] Internet HW
- [x] CB Readings

Called Aboo in the morning. Xiaohongshu. Met with Mason. Met with Paul. Notes from [James Quiambo](https://www.jquiambao.com/). Interview with Yaroslov, WSJ correspondent, February? Look at Navajo code talkers. Find a semantic map to zero in on verbal redundancies—words should cluster around central ideas. Dinner with Alec. Engelbart's mice. Product of arts writing: we look at things in terms of zingers. Accelerate writing velocity. IIT's train tube accelerated Abloh.

No time after 9:30 tomorrow. Work tonight.

Today presents an unbound capacity for goodness. 
Make for Making's Sake. Generative vs prohibitive mindsets.

What AI Means for Writing
In an age of mass media, it's wise to be prudent about what you put out. What does it mean to write in an age where ChatGPT can deliver ultrapersonalized content to your mailbox any time you want?

ChatGPT's "tasks" might have just destroyed traditional media, or at least significantly raised the bar for quality of content given auto-generated newsletters. Though this may not be any different compared to the Human Generative Engine. To what degree are we the same black box, Chinese room, endlessly recombining and reinterpreting our inputs? Maybe our edge is not in the sort of box we are, but rather in the types of inputs we receive.

Here at least is how we differ (for now):
1. our inputs are multimodal—touch, taste, see, smell
2. our inputs are others—friends, family, strangers.
3. our inputs are serendipitous. 
Given we're different in these ways, we should have this inform our writing. 

Alt-realization:
For AI's to gain fidelity, we need more receptors/ways of encoding input information.

BIGGEST BLOCK TO OUR WRITING: vox clamantis

What does prospect theory mean for goal-setting? Because the curve is steepest as one approaches 0, you always work hardest right before you are about to achieve a goal.
