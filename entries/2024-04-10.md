Showered and freshened up. We’ve got to go easier on the body. Grabbed breakfast at Baker. Did our Haylon slides. Grabbed food with Anderson. Applied to a couple metra postings. Ask Nancy for help—just something to finance our stay here this summer. Updated Mom and Dad on our plans. Read Vonnegut for clarity. Honey butter sandwich before Authoritarian regimes. Still not sure how we feel about the class. Talked to Joe about the stamps scholar program. 

Saturday we travel through wormwood  
And the bygones of our wonder years   
fade into rear view. Southwest of Joliet  
the birds fly with impervious speed.

Forecast for this week:  
2 meetings to nail—tomorrow with Nick Epley and Friday with Andrea.  
Do our homework  
Sources of summer funding: Chicago/Campus/Sunshine Action?  
Chicago Review/TAPs. We just need to talk to a person.   
Wage-earning, freelancing, passive income streams.

Layer 1: we’re a matchmaking service that connects strangers to meet up.  
Layer 2: we’re a service for that pairs serial killers with people looking to be euthanized  
Layer 3: we’re a law enforcement tool for police to catch killers.
