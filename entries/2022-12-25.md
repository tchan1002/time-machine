Day 8  
Christmas. Call Aboo tonight. Sent out an email for winter IMs. Return to Chicago a better man. Went out on a three miler. Elinor Fuchs’ visit to a small planet. The Chicago International Puppet Festival. A Moby Dick puppet show?

Dreamt that we were in a city again. Hong Kong, but drier and colder. Climbed a grassy slope by the highway to get to Aboo’s apartment. 

Song: Waiting for Love by Avicii.
