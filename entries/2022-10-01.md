City of stars. Ordered our screen protector. The Strumbellas. Had breakfast. Michael Clancy. Cowspiracy. Pandas are supposed to be carnivores. Kurosawa. Western’s root’s in Samurai films. Went to Powell's books with Seth. Got a refund. Scott Pilgrim. 5:30 dinner back in the dorm. Had drunken noodles at noodles etc. Mom, Chloe, and Aboo sent us a birthday message. Updated mom on recent things. Acquired ginger ale, reminiscent of our Fay days. One can choose to make significant days. Showmanship. The Believer. Ryan Gosling. Did pushups for Thompson at the Talent Show. Ran down and back from Student Wellness. Talked to Sophia. Oscillating between misanthropy and compassion. La La Land. Do homework and laundry in the morning. Don’t worry about tomorrow night.

Prompt: A man lives what he thinks is his last day. Knees to stomach, arms over head, he began the day crunched up, fetal under the dark folds of the covers. The first hazy light filtered through his window…

Mr. Blanchard’s hammer and spear.

Song: We Don’t Know by the Strumbellas.
