Walked to Woodlawn for breakfast. When Harry Met Sally. Harry’s crazy with it. Moved downstairs to the third floor lounge. Antigone. Curry spice noodles for dinner. Called Holden. See if we can crash at someone’s in New York. Thomas? Borrowed William’s sewing kit for our shoes. Golden slumbers. Filled in a writing survey for Tommy. Goodpain.
