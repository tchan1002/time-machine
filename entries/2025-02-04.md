Called Aboo. Bart mart: grabbed a twix bar for lunch. Head to BPSB and talked with Vogel for about an hour. A lunch lady at Bart is turning 88 next month: 55 years of the University through her eyes. Went back to North to nap. Ended up sleeping in. Made rice and beans with Lola. Incoming storm this weekend. 

The circumpunct.
Systems programming.

If community is the possibility of collisions, we want to be in the business of serendipity.

Eat well, sleep well. be clean.

Notes from Vogel:
- Measure thrice, cut once.
- Things of scale are prone to death by a thousand cuts. Little errors grow exponential when stacked.
- Vogel and Awh are interested in creative data entry.
- The unfortunate fact of today is that data lies with corporationsâ€”so that's where we have to be.
