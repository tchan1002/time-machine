Day 21  
Three weeks. A victory for the ubermensch. Figure out how to operate a camera. Make Toki Pona flashcards. Head out at 4 pm. Steven Yuen. Prebake our pieces. Finished Nope. Nope’s end scene. Gorgeous. Eadweard Maybridge, Plate 626\. Charged our phone for a 5 pm run. Watched two episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Went out and long. Returned the weasel to home depot. Ran down to New Haven. Pulled up to the FunZ trampoline park. All green, W day. Credible backstories. Called Clark. Drink water. Call Jesalina sometime.

What if we pulled up to the FunZ trampoline park?  
Last night of school, silly silly us told her about the amber of the moment.   
Ferris bueller? He had a day off.

Writing lately like a newborn screaming out “look, look, we’re alive.” But I guess if you were taking in your first gasps of air you’d scream too.
