Day 47  
Woke up and showered. Push out a cool cat. Drink water. Read. Called Aboo. Keep the water cycle going. Clean and get back on the road. The planets opus 32\. Finally won protobowl. Went out for a run. Felt good. Ran easy. Clean the sink. Pablo Neruda. Bread and cheese and Sufjan Stevens. Feasting with my eyes. Ask for pictures from convention. Go swim. Feeling ourselves again. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Man straight up lying about the Latin.

Playing 505 at that lavender magic time of night.  
The curtains set sail like boats, and the stars have us conquered.

“That belongs in a museum.”

Song: 505 by the Arctic Monkeys.
