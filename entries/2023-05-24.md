Noodles from Zofie by divine providence. Settled in the Fifth Floor lounge. White winter hymnal carried us through our poli-sci final. Subsisted off food in the lounge. Leah’s mana, pecan cookies. Grabbed some food from the homeroom. Worked until ten. Submitted. This nightmarish thing. Gave our letters to Sophia and Devin. Said goodbye to folks down in the lounge. Who am I? Alone in the ihouse courtyard. Last night in our room. Guillermo’s Pinocchio.

Walzer and Beitz. Reiterative universalism. Human creativity expressed in diverse political systems.
