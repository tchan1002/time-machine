Day 1  
Packed in the morning. Master plan for quality of life improvements. Went to get a flu shot with mom. Archie picked us up for the airport. Siddartha. Capture sunset. BDL’s playlist is kind of sick. Animals by Neon Trees. Crashing at Elijah’s tonight. Little people on the plane, they asked us to balance the flight. Delayed two hours. 20 Chicken McNuggets for dinner. Thunderstorms visible in the distance. Got to Chicago. Took a lyft to Elijah’s. Showered and slept. 

Do a multiple self-portrait.  
Moon photography.

Think the dominating emotion this summer has been anger. Saw the poor, the sick, the dying, and realized an anti-Siddhartha. All these hands reaching and we close our eyes. Oscillating between excessive sentimentality and unfounded optimism.
