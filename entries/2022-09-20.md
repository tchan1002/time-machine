Moved in. Found out about our plum allergy at lunch. Lost our voice momentarily. Triggered a fire alarm at Woodlawn, trying to open the door for Oia. Walked past the quad, went to see the Reg. Hung out with Noah in Woodlawn. Met Saul, Noah’s roommate. Played a boardgame about cities and coins. Walked around with Jack and Dellara. Lots of Exeter people around. Took a tour of ihouse and the special elevator. Thought Aymane’s name was spelt Aemin.
