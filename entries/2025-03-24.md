First day of Spring. Pope class. Marx. 5 plates of fish for dinner. Kimani. Finished (P)rind episode. Okay to leave things be. Spend one day tired. Go up to hang out with Holden. Pushup failure. Went out seven miles. Frigid. Stopped by bartmart. 2 magnum ice creams and a bag of gummy warms. Ulysses audio book. Check Ulysses syllabus. Fingers frozen frigid, spindly dawn. επι οινομα ποντον as they say—or something like that. 1:31 AM substack post on Basquiat's work ethic. Long time coming. 

Pope class:
The first sign of the dissolution of the Empire were the loss of their maxipads. Sponges they used to harvest from the warm coasts of portugal no longer arrived by the same trade routes. Clothes became rougher, sheep less fluffy. Prices of books rose astronomically as parchment replaced papyrus.

The body, cell death, necrosis.
