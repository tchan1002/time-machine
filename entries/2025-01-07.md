#### Must Do's

Morning. Showered. Grabbed breakfast. Left for class. Human communication. Grabbed lunch with Anderson and Ryan, met Aaron. Settled in a stuart cubicle. Hyperefficient language may be properly nonverbal. SBDI orientation with Paul. Email from Nick Briz, we're moving. Dinner with Eva McCord. Maybe the things that death prompts us to think about are not necessarily the ones important to living. Moda meeting. Little inspo from Will Hu. "Are we closer"

At a real lost of who we are and how we could contribute to society. Tremulis and sons. 

Saccadic movements. The eye twitches 4 times a second. The whole world in stitched fixations.
