Day 46  
The search for the Holy Grail. Complete our tasks. Try to drain the sink. Unclogged the sink. Mac and cheese. Hypostasis. Prey looks sick. Wash up. The Fisher King. Neruda Love Sonnet XI. Refund within 45 days. Jasper AITA. Get outside tomorrow. The Sandman. Joe “Loaf”.

The butter resisted our knife, still… butter sandwich tonight?
