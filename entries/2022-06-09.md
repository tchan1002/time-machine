Day 103  
Heavy rain again in the morning. Was a good idea to go to sleep, always time during the day. Current Schedule may be too strict but we should Anki. Found an 80% Frequency deck for Greek. Start with the AGON stories. The AnKing. Reddit as a resource. Made a language exchange post. Check back. Petrified wood. Angel of small death. Fetor and fertile. Called Allen. Gotta visit New York sometime. Chicago ultimate frisbee team. Blueprint. Open Ultimate. Head out at 5 for our run. Eddie, we’ve only seen him in one episode and he’s already our favorite character. Better Call Saul opening scene, that’s how you do it. First response on Reddit. Litter the Vehicle. Hillsdale college courses. Divine comedy. Voirici. Went on Omegle. Met Lutia from Slovakia. Omegle college is good for looking through. Tabarnak. Chatting up the Quebecois. Picturesque skies, looking like Toy Story out there. Chloe made a smoothie. Wanting to go to bed right now. Take a nice jog just to say we did it. Showered. Think we’ll write our coolcat post. “Beautiful…Beautiful…Absolutely beautiful.” Think we’ll have a cool cat post tomorrow. Universal Consciousness.
