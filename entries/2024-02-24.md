Woke up to our second set of RA interviews. Grabbed lunch at Baker. Moved to CSIL to lay out Sliced Bread. Keith haring the doodles, bubble gum the title. Caught up with Fredric over hutch. Made a stop at bartmart. Spaghetti strat*, donâ€™t let him cook\!* Sunset over a grateful universe. Cyantotype t-shirt prints. Cut our hair and cleaned up. Layed out some pages with indesign. 

A bird red, raw like new shorn antlers.  
Afford ourselves to dream again.
