Visit the library archives before grad. Took a headshot for college. Applied to both programs in New York. Stay up. Maybe we’ll wear goggles, like when we were at our cousins’ and had cat allergy. The Pentaverate. Mike Myers is Canadian? Eamin has covid. Hope we don’t. To be toast. Swedish goggles. Sharkskin wasabi grater. Not to be doomed to obscurity. Sectioning off parts of our screen print? “Long been fascinated.” Pick up on our log. Moved to Architecture Club. Applications of Bernoulli’s Principle. On whether information occupies physical space. Did our laundry. Get to the library early. Justice Deferred on Display. 

How unfortunate that our friendly smile confines us to the torturous fate of being approachable.
