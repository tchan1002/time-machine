Day 61  
The dawn, a piercing light over the horizon. Sunrise above the clouds. Arrived in Hong Kong. Took the E23A bus back to To Kwa Wan, thought we saw Mia. Hallucinations. Got home and napped till 4 in the afternoon. Ate. Reconstructed our entries for Thailand. Produce something coherent. Return to R2A. Put our Joan of Arc piece on medium. Published a coolcat. To be in communion with others, our central tenet. Eywa in Avatar.

Real considerations on the ethics of tourism, what does it mean to have a city not designed for the people who live there. Infrastructure challenges of Bangkok. City planning and megamalls.
