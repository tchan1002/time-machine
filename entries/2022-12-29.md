Day 4  
Back to our spreadsheets. Might as well listen to Moby Dick as we do it. Moby Dick’s Chapter 2 was so sus. Chapter Three with Queequeg was double sus. Put in a good 10 hours of work today. Called Grace, who’s in California. Returning to Chicago now on the first of January. Took a late shower.
