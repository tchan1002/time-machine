Woke up. Emailed Seraphina about lecture. Scanned in our gradescope. Compose our close reading. Made stack. Onwards from Indianapolis. Met with Powley. Email winter break and summer dates. Quant research? Greek odes. Had dinner at Woodlawn. Mock trial, an obsession. Steph, our Thomas Wang figure? Called Will Park. Had wings at Tiffins. Did our laundry. Pick up tomorrow morning. Return to activity. 

On the defense. Grind until scrap turns gold. Two chances, Irvine and Berkley. Relax and get to love our team. Definition of dedication to a craft. Practice and practice. To the point of the most miniscule. Every gesture, every movement calculated. Smile. Use both hands. Wide stance.
