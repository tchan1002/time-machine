Day 66  
Slept in. Went out to Shek Mun and Fo Tan to pick up our HKID and 回鄉證. Took the train to the office. Obtained a Wall Street Journal subscription through UChicago. Came back to have tea with Aboo and Gonggong. Left for the airport. Feeling the squats from yesterday. Just as the train left. Checked in at the airport. Tried our hand at vlogging. Meet a metcalf*.* Read Kenzaburo Oe’s *Seventeen* on the plane. A most normal seventeen year old. Sailed through the night. 

19 years are about to pass through the pinhole of two hours. The written text as a bending of time and space. Consider the medium through which we communicate, the condensation, splicing of a consciousness. All to afford someone the ability to sit in our head for a little while.

Feeling strong about the recent affirmative action news. Asian Americans thrust into the limelight. Our old friend Calvin Yang’s speaking for Students for Fair Admissions. God bless America. *God bless Asian American children.*
