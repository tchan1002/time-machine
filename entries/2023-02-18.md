Dad called at 10:00. Another two hours. *Free my shade from this hollow prison of my flesh*. Thought about Matt Clemson. Drew the blinds and fell asleep again to Amazing Grace. What if some freak accident. Woke up and went to the RA meet and greet. Master rizzler, weasler. A rendition of *bella sicomme un angel*. Walked back to ihouse. Put our sheets in the laundry and vacuumed our room. Stopped by the mock trial scrimmage en route to hutch. Caught up with Katie about the post-mock trial. *Midnight in Paris* as we walked towards Hutch. Ended up crashing the Afro-Caribbean culture show. Sat down with Adan. The wild drumming of African beats. Took a break after intermission. Met Isabella outside of Max P. Ate at pret and walked her back. Ran into Bryan and Indelicarto—apparent suitmates. Played smash with them and Matteo in Max P East. Our wounded bird rizz may be too strong. Went to Bernardo’s. Charcuterie board. Stayed in and called Amber. 

*Did you know your hands were digging into my back?*
