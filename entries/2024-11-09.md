Woke up at 7:00. Showered. Ran into Gayathri headed out of North. Caught her lyft to rendezvous with Mock Trial at the 59th Metra Station. Took the train up. Photographed rounds. We feel much better about it. Still got it. Red lined and took a lyft back home. Cleaned house, shaved, showered, and dashed to Trader Joe's all in an hour. Made pasta with Tori. Stayed up. Read our dictionary. Finished Susan Sontag's Regarding the Pain of Others. Kafka on the Shore.

Exiting underworldsâ€”Ulysses, Omeros missing mother, father, wife.
