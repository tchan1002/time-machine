Slept in—or to be more accurate, schlept. Our muscles decimated. Dad’s willing to foot our bills but we’ve got to show something. Took the train down to Kennedy town. Finish Who’s On episodes so we don’t owe anyone shit. We get ourselves out of the hole that way. 鲸. Nail the short story. Suns out and so is the crowd. Yuen campus with Faerin. Worked through the UCSP episode. We have all the creative license to make it however we want. Introduce dramatis personae. Left at 6:20. The 5b crawled sluggishly towards causeway bay. Picked up our new phone from Aunt Julie at the apple store. Bowl of beef noodles. Train home. Reboot the substack, shed what's overwrought. Bring a gift for sunny tomorrow. 

Two summers ago we were in Kennedy town chasing the black moth. The sea spawned at the end of the street just as it did today. We walked on foot up the hill.

What didn't work with our plan? We didn't wake up that early. 9:30 start we're still at home and grind out stuff. Solution: hard sleep time the day before.

Concrete visualization:
- mornings we take the train down to booth, read geertz on the way.
- leave at 8 we get there at 9.
- 9-10 we freewrite (nanowrimo)
- 10-12 we knock out tasks
- 12-1 we grab lunch
- 1-3 language class
- 3-5 work on vibecoding the damn thing
- 5-6 explore
- night free, go back home.

One big heavy thing makes up for all our faults.
