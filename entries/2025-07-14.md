- [x] Coolcat

Class in the morning. Guru Ifan and Guru Yoga helped us prep for our dalang interview. Gocared back home so that we could sleep for 20. Leaned all the way back and had the best time. Makan siang with Bapak Prijo. Broccoli carrot soup. Went to meet Pak Eko at his house/puppet studio south-west of Jogja. Had the best time. Stepped up for a real interview in Bahasa Indonesia. 3 hours from 1 to 4. Snacked on cassava and had hot sweet tea when our camera overheat. Pak Marwanto's experimenting with making wayang out of canvas (instead of cowhide). Scrubs the canvas and tosses them in a pool to cool off. Fascinating old men. Went back home and had a fret about lost video files. Dinner after Ibu Dian came back. Fired up our lightroom—been too long. Had a nice long call with Aboo. Gave her a virtual tour of Ibu Dian's. 

Pak Eko tells us that the soul of the puppet is in the eyes. He draws them last. 画龙点睛. Puppeteering is a transfer of energy into the body of the puppet. Animate the inanimate.

Woke up today with a keen sense that our one goal senior year should be finding a way to live in new york. That's Rome and we need to be in it. There's no alternative. We need to be at the heart of the empire. That's where our friends will be and where we will be too.

Buy ourselves cheese, water, and jambu air. Load money.
