Woke up and showered. Met Jennifer in front of the reg. Carpooled to Midway. Finally read the Symposium, via Will Parkâ€™s recommendation. Descended upon the wooded forests and the gentle slopes of New England. Archie picked us up. Stopped for the bathroom at a Skooters. Back home in Connecticut. Talked to mom about transferring. 

Shook that Plato described love as originating from poverty. What a revelation.
