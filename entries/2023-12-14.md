Day 20  
Lara should be back soon. Reach out. Lunch. Went out for an afternoon run. Sergio on Sliced Bread. The edification of our linkedin page. Insomnia sponsored a midnight read of Pendulum. To make something—big big plans for sliced bread. Reached out to people on the studio track for potential artist features. Start drinking in the new year. *Never be cowardly, never be cruel*. Pick up our camera and start rolling, there’s a reason why the windshield is bigger than the rearview mirror (via Big Cheese)

Sliced Bread, develop our social media account. BOTD (Book of the Day)  
Templates have to make the artist's features digestible.  
Use this break to figure our stuff out—add/drop micro for next quarter

Memento: We may not be far from the darkest timeline, things can go wrong very quickly. To be reminded at times that the realities of loneliness can be so crushing. Where did we go wrong? Spend what we have to make memories with our family. Memories we can look back on and feel warm about. Be kind to mom. 

Maybe we should get we’re not really strangers—it did give us our first kiss with Jacqueline.  
Would be nice to play with our parents, a makeshift life story interview kit.
