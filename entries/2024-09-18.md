**Day 3**  
Picked up our new blazers. Low Top 77’ Vintage. Spent the morning at an RA resource fair. Kublai’s 519-72-3242. Intentional Conversations. Tried to ollie on Zayd’s board after lunch. Retrieved our encyclopedias from the lounge. Dnikemon in full swing. Went down to Woodlawn to eat. Siya, South RA, told us she had a good time in Application Development. Had a reckoning, dropped econometrics. Pored through course feedback for an hour. Registered for a 9 person seminar. Reread an excerpt from Coetzee’s Elizabeth Costello, which Licha had assigned us last winter. Kill the Whale. Midnight run.

Dug up old bones. Reread our rejection letter from Fundamentals. It was meant to be. *What makes something strange* was a fascinating question, but one that we could not have fully dedicated ourselves to.
