Grabbed some tea in the morning. Grind out our paper today. We're good at doing this. Sliced Bread Merch? Checkpoint pictures, instant photos printed on receipt paper. Annie’s Charcuterie study break—asked to inherit her list of ideas. Submitted our religion paper. 

Something about Mithraism. A voice that told us *you shall go out and break bread with strangers*. An enterprise to not go hungry, to be in communion. We study frats, we study religious groups.
