Slept in. Met the mock people at breakfast. Started snowing out. Walked to Hinds for our exoplanets lecture. King asleep in the mountain—Motif D1960.2. The Bachelor wikipedia page. Grabbed lunch with Tae. Short lines at the Halal station because of Ramadan. God-awful sinks in the Harper 2nd floor bathroom. Settled in a Stuart cubicle. Sent out our soccer email. We ball. Mary Beard’s coming to town. Hopped out of our econ class to catch some sleep. The afternoon sun. Slow roving train over the bridge like some sort of Japanese scene. Made noodles. Worked in the Fifth floor lounge. Golden hour. Get our handle back on Econ. Went swimming. The day can always be saved. Devoured some Jumbo Wings at Tiffins with Devin. Ubermensch. 

Called back to life by a reel: Rise young warrior, you must get up. *“The Quest” Teen Titans, Episode 41\.*
