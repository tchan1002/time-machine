Went to our religion class. Met with Henry. 80,000 hours. Chiaroscuro. Really proud of our Jeremy Zucker pictures. Ate with Ryan. Met for our micro group. Fix our Kanii article this weekend. Grilled cheese and tomato soup at Joe and Cristi’s apartment. Played codenames with the RAs. Under the Silver Lake, plot’s a feverish discoscape. 

All our lives we are corralled and herded in every which direction.   
Switched our flight to Friday, we can always make money back. 

*The grace of god, to come in so battered from the storm*. This was what we were thinking as we had grilled cheese and tomato soup at Joe and Cristi’s apartment. 

And all round the ruckus ran knights of yore/ Their hollow faces/ their ransacked eyes.

Dream: In the wasteland of what used to be the pier, I dreamt of every member of my family. By the rusted containers and the desecrated concrete. Craters the size of the fist of God. We laid down and watched the sky. This was the edge of memory. To my right was your face pressed against mine. To the left was the sea, to the left was oblivion.
