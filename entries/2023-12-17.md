Day 17  
Woke up at 8:00. Picked up our laundry. Showered and brushed our teeth. Change by Big Thief. Go hike the sleeping giant. Made congee for breakfast. Our little food channel. Tropic Thunder is wild. Texted Jackie. 22 responses on our sliced bread form\! Make our first meeting back really good. Learn DaVinci Resolve. Went out for a two miler. The mist. Visions from dreams we put into words. 

Doctrine: Our faith, a budding theology. The question of human existence is, in its most pragmatic form, what is suffering and how do we resolve it. Our first proposition: loneliness. A separation of our consciousness via the prisons of our flesh. *Man can you understand me*. 

Aurora Borealis. Frederic Erwin Church’s paintings.  
Something distinctly American about the existentialist protagonist—the cowboy.
