Up at 5:00. Listened through a documentary about two black kids at the Dalton school. At least we've never had anyone doubt our intelligence. Michael Reeve's Reef.ly. Felt so rushed this morning. Got to class and found out our IG is due next week. We're chilling. Reached out to Gabe to chat tomorrow about class and interviewing. Nap, shower. *Still in the 95 to 100.* Our legs are a little sore. Showered. BM Shift. [[Noah]] stopped by and told us to re-read Catcher in the Rye. Caught up with appdev. Man we're good. Had a productive Lives of Others class. Napped softly. Ate with [[Lucas]]. Construction in Weth is almost finished. 

Tomorrow morning
- [x] Laundry
- [x] Clean room

Make some of Will Hu's soy cured egg yolks.

Gear up for appdev so that we're familiar with AI.
The only new social networks we need are physical.
Maybe we get a job at Elon and Vivek's DOGE.
Make something people want. (starts with making something we want)

Need a shower with hot water.
WBEZ visit tomorrow. 
Ought to look at webapps as dressed up data entry forms.

[[Webapp Ideas]]
Users submit sentiment analysis. 
Display phrase, and users can mark as positive or negative.

Or maybe users are shown two products and asked which products they would choose to purchase. They are given a budget to spend from. 
Can test menusâ€”give an option for restaurant to enter in items and prices. 

The truth may very well be that we don't give a damn about other people.
