Day 98  
Woke up lazy, meeting Clark in the evening. Cooked croissant and eggs. Varna Man. Phone may arrive today. Salt and the sea. Music and our primitive brains. Webinar tomorrow at 1 PM. The Free State Project. Facetimed Indigo. Cook rice and meat tomorrow. Keep the water cycle going. Call Annalisa. Meeting Clark at 7:30. Get back to Oscar Wilde. Play music. Went on a run with Clark on the bike trials. Walked back and paid a visit to Walmart. Call Jacqueline tomorrow. Recoup. Facetime Annalisa. God this movie is a gold mine. Not Another Teen Movie. Get back on track. 

Have sort of forgotten the rules of normal human interaction.
