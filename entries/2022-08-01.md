Day 50  
Return to Gigachad. Jollypong. The Common. Notes on Looking Back by Steven Tagle. Shittymorph. Ideas for a podcast. Found footage. Went down to the bike trail. Goated weather. Ran easy. Took the bus back. Acquired oat milk, eggs, and oranges. Another successful grocery trip. Make a cool cat post. Finish Dark. Poodle moths. Write write write. EPVN Drafts. Cooking congee. Keep the water cycle going and the music playing. Go hit up 120 tomorrow. Took a nap. Had a really nice talk with someone from Sweden on omegle. Did not work on good bones. Bad look. Fallacy of the continuum. The meek shall inherit the earth. Hopped on a Kirtland call. Protobowl. Write tomorrow. Dulce et decorum est. Bird in Space. The last king of Scotland.

“I will fight no more forever.”
