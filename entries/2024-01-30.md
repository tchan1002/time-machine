A lemon tea for breakfast with Zophie. Two sundays. Sunday based off of Sunday, Seurat and Jonathan Larsson. Grabbed lunch with Giancarlo, Emily, and Lincoln. Finished up on our puppet article. The Immortal Jellyfish Girl and *Gotterdammerung.* People keep telling us about that black mirror episode when we talk about Trackpatch. Grabbed a hot chocolate with Celina at Ex Lib. Worked on our tasks. Grabbed pancake supplies from Trader Joes. Dropped by Firebird. Our snowball pics made it to @uchicagocollege. Joe crowned us with a chef’s hat. Made banana pancakes. We’re winning.

Some fuel to keep the engine running.
