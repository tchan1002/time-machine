Flew from Amsterdam to Rome. Took a bus to Termini station. The Roman Sun. Saw the building from Titus 1999—Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. Rome meshed with its old ruins. Sunken garden, Colossus. Checked into our airbnb. Took a shower and cleaned up. Build our word count back up now. The earlier volta of an Italian sonnet. Dante in egg tempera. Napped on a soft beige couch. Read up on Italy and Rome.

“M'insegnavate come l'uom s'etterna” Inf.15.85  
The ceiling of this Roman room, the etched tiles.
