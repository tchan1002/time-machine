Day 18  
Late start to the day. Sent out emails for calls to the artists we’ve emailed. Some fabulous chicken soup. Emilia Jones. Work on FESAP. 5:25 and it’s all dark outside. Get BTS footage for FESAP. Dig around our basement to see what we can find. 

Truth is stranger than fiction and fiction is truer than truth.   
We’ve got an odd looking face and perhaps that’s the best way to put it.
