Day 101  
Woke up early. Mom drove us to Cornell Scott Hill. *In Xanadu did Kublai Khan*, our mantra in the dentistâ€™s chair*.* Crossed second avenue as we entered new york. Got our grades back in the car. 4.0 school year, academic weapon we are. Why no monkeys in North America? Arrived in long Island, home of the Great Gatsby. Feasted on ribs. Went out for a cool two miler. Slept on a cot. Alleviate soreness. 

Emanating spheres, light cones, the collision of our probabilities.   
A meeting of Your Name enthusiasts, the apotheosis of an ordinary set of stairs.   
A photograph, homegoing, a puncture in the space-time continuum between subject and viewer.   
The cogent power of narrative in helping us contextualize the fragmentary nature of our lives.   
Futurama, in how many shows are the ruins of a city left subterranean, necropoli.   
The vegetation lining the interstate on Long island, overlapping canopies, branching draping greenery. 

Notes: Talked to Uncle, who teaches maritime business at the Merchant Marine Academy. Ship finance. 4k to 100k swings. London, Singapore, Shanghai. Maritime law. Seafaring economics.
