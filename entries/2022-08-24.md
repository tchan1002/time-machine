Day 27 **Highlight: Night Run**  
Brushed our teeth. Called BoA. Explored multilingual dictionaries. Gavagai. Language acquisition. “The arbitrariness of the sign.” Exolinguistics? Translated 西遊記. Finished a Silent Voice. Final Verdict: Mid. Ran in the neighborhood. Ache Te Vitu. Island Mango Kombucha. Finish our reflections in the next couple of days. Genuinely and pleasantly surprised by how many people we’ve kept in touch with this summer. Ogden Nash.

“Arm back, bleak blood, body, bone, brain.”

“All the while, the stone monkey learned to prance about in the mountains. It ate the wildgrass and drank from the mountain streams. It plucked flowers and fruit off the trees, and walked with the wolves and the critters. It slept under a cliff face, and when dawn came, set out to swim in the caverns. The stone monkey lived a life of leisure, and the years passed without end in the mountain shade.” Journey to the West 1:9
