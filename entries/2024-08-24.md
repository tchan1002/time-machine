**Day 29**  
Woke up around 9:00. Walked over to Cafe du Monde. Green and white. Met Kelli. Beignets, 油炸鬼. Coffee with chicory. Octavia Spencer made a cameo. Jackson park. Spotted the decks of two skaters, Kevin and Trayvon, who did ollies for us. Said bye to Kelli. Napped. Dylan picked us up from our hostel. Po’ boys and Gumbo at Salvo’s Seafood. Iced tea. Waffle house lore on drive back. Dylan dropped us off at Audubon Park. Towering oak trees and birds—swans, geese, egrets. Walked north along the lagoon, met Diego taking pictures on his fujifilm. Idled.  
Met some freshmen from Tulane on the streetcar. Todor from Bulgaria. Wooden benches, windows down. Cleaned up. Napped. Made the last of our noodles. Snacked on some bread. Midnight brother’s chicken. They do make chicken good here. Walked up and down Bourbon street. Moroccan mint. 

Ithaka on Thomas Wang’s wall. 

Observe tombstone epitaphs for what matters most to people. “Brother, son, father, friend” we distill ourselves down to our closest relationships.
