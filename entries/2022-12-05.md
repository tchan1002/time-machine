Settled in the fifth floor house lounge. Grind out. Aeneas and Anchises. Talked to Phil about transferring. Grow as we go. Running through Sufjan Stevens. Submitted our hum essay. Compartmentalizing god? Review for math tonight. Deal with add/drop later. Sent Moreau an email. Full speed ahead on math review. White winter hymnal on loop. Ended up submitting our sosc paper. Go to bed now. Review epsilon delta proofs in the morning.
