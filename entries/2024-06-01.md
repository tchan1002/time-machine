**Day 111**  
First day of June, pouring. Ran into Ermelinda, met Ava. Grabbed medici and had such a nice convo with them about urban design and our project. Went to west grad. Said bye to our friends. Slept and rotted. Cleaned up our room. Had dinner. Finished editing our senior pics. Send them out tomorrow morning. 

We bring New York to Chicago.   
Eventuals: buildspace, Y Combinator.

Picnic cpg sponsorship? Show food items.
