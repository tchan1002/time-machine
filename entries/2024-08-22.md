**Day 31**  
Slept in. Nice shower. Stopped by Medici. Grabbed our stuff from Cobb. Reg, Ex Lib, Kofi heated up a chocolate croissant for us. Returned shirts to Moran. A bike cannibalized on the sidewalk. Went out to grab supplies at Trader Joes. Walked back and napped in the A level. We are tired as hell. Union station again. Downed the Mango Kefir. Ran into a bunch of UIUC kids headed back to school. City of New Orleans. Wrote arts blurb. Got to know Norman, headed down to Jackson for a funeral. Talked photography, running, and diets. He loved Roy Ayers. 

Pedro Paramo.   
Here we go. 

Kid came up to us and asked us ten dollars for a bus fare back to Shuresville, Indiana. Fresh cut on his right cheek and soot covered hands. Didnâ€™t know whether to believe him. Or if it matters.
