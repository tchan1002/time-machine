Woke up at 7:00 to the Bay area fog. Walked to Berkeleyâ€™s campus with Henry. Dwinelle Hall. Lox schmear at the Bagel shop. Sampled Jewish cuisine. Fear is the mind killer, did our litany against fear with the other C team down the hallway. Stumbled our round but men of science fear us. Had chipotle for lunch. Watched the P round. The Berkeley clock tower. Ran into John Lee across the street. Texted Will Park. Had a fresh spring roll at a Vietnamese place. Fantastic. Joined in a Berkeley dance group practice. Ryan came over to the super 8\. Rested.
