Day 1  
Summer camp in Montreal, our time in France. Giant macarons. Went out for a three miler. Felt great. *Where do you go to, my lovely?* Grabbed some groceries on our way back. Brined duck tongues and congee for dinner.  

Evening nap, dreamt that we were in a building, all climbing walls 10 stories tall. Vibrant cityscapesâ€”we want to be in LA or New York.
