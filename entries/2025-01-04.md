Arrived in Chicago early morning. Took the 55 bus back to school. Settled in Fairgrounds. Moved to the Reg. Kayla's in the same boat as us. Hung out with Daniel. Sat for a bit in the A-Level. Mason found a room for us in Thompson 203. 

Oddly nostalgic to spend our night in IHouse. We're in 203, one of the rooms that Bernardo and Chris had. View of the courtyard. Walked up to the 3rd floor lounge, the fifth floor lounge, and our old room 525. Looked at the elevator. Those nights we'd come in cold and stiff and stuffy. Never been as sick or at home as in our life.
