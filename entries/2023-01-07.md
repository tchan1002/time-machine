*Jitterbug\!* Ubered to UC Irvine. Went long on our Savchenko cross. Sampled Californian cuisine at In N Out. Succulent Bushes. Took a nap and talked to Elijah during the second half of P’s round. Ubered back to the motel 6 to change before heading to Huntington beach. Little fires and the sand. Ran with Ryan into the Pacific. Compliment circle on Jack’s uber back to the motel 6\. Called Amber. Think we just like really pretty people. Hot political takes with Ryan.
