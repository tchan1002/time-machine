Dreamed that it was raining hard and we had class. The Elements of Style. Concise and definitive description. History records but literature endures. Took a fat nap. Come back to Sisyphus later. Capitalism fuels its own end. Marx. The Lumpenproletariat. Class consciousness. Good gracious you’re a heart attack. Short time, 14 days. Alternative solutions to revolution? It is about the deprivation of meaning. The moderate man that is the greatest enemy to social change. “They have a world to win.” Social power and responsibility. Lazy prices. Went out for a run. Nice weather out, fine mist, wish we could have stayed out longer. Work hard. Rest on the Flight into Egypt. Luc Olivier Merson. Reminder: Get There There.

Meditations on Marx’s Manifesto: The proletariat comes as a product of Capitalism. The goals of the proletariat class, represented by the Communists, can only be achieved through the attainment of class consciousness, radical revolution and the overtaking of political supremacy. Communists should always support the upheaval of social order as, according to Marx, communism is the final stage of disintegration in the evolution of social hierarchies.
