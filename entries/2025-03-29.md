Empires falling? Windy Ventures is interviewing students and builders. Called Kimani, is Diego's notinterview's going to snuff us? How do we produce better content. Quit our lab, wrote to Chong. Picked up our notebooks. As long as we don't lose favor. Recover. Went to Bartlett to eat. Caught up with Bhone. Went up to Elijah's. Sleep and recover.

There and then, we moult.
