Toothpaste stains. The dentists canceled. Weâ€™re staying in. Send a stranger our photos to put up. Withdrew from our micro class. Sent Chloe off to the bus stop. Went for groceries with mom. Updates. This terribly insular earth. Shades of blue. Texted Vanessa. Go into West Rock tomorrow. Bring our camera. Learn how to make an omurice. Work on our little projects to fill the time. Raining out. 

The body has been a dull vehicle \[if the core is not already a wrangled mass\]. So strip away the flesh, strip away the ugliness. Say that the camel will pass into light to go through the eye of the needle. *As will we.*

Song: Kyoto by Phoebe Bridgers.
