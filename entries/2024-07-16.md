**Day 66**  
Put on socks. Walked over to Woodlawn for some food. Took the red up to DePaul. Saw Dylan. Made some friends at Iowa and Northwestern. West world, fidelity. Vietnamese college consulting came in handy. Acquired business cards. Regained confidence. The sun over the Fullerton station. Took the red back. Ran to the point. Lost our shirt. Rode a divvy bike on the road. *Naked and afraid.* Showered. Made congee. Prep for tomorrow. 

Mr. Bigtimer, make 100 dollars selling lemonade.
