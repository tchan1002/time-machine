Day 43 **Highlight: The Movie Prey**  
Transcribed the Yale Mosaic. Picked up our clothes. Caramelized onions. Apparent rain. Second sun. Go visit museums. Prey, what a film. Parallels of predator and prey. Sound design. A cinematic experience. Loved the predator’s skull mask. Went down to the trails. Hot but felt good in the shade. Ran up the hill on our way back. Move our grocery trip to tomorrow. Bread, milk and eggs. Limbs are a good tired. To living eventful days. Edit tomorrow. Shower and run thoughts. Vacuum and learn to make smoothies. Orange is the new black. Ah Deva.

Transcription of the Yale Mosaic:  
“αλα θαυματα καλα φε(?????) ιεροφαντης   
ανθρωποις οι τηνδε πολιν και (παιαν) εχουσιν  
ουν (εκεν οικον ε) δεινε μαθηταις πρωτοσταταις   
Πετρω και Παυλω τοις γαρ σθενος (ανθετοσωτερ)   
αργυρεοις κοσμοις (ι) και ευ βαφε εσσι λιθοι-σιν   
κλεινος Αναστασιος θεο μηδεα πιστα διδασκων”  
Saw this as a sign… “Trail closed at dusk.”

Coolcat: Thinking of starting something new here and making more frequent posts. Have been keen on not desensitizing y’all to black squares, but could use a reminder to approach each day with a sense of adventure. A picture, a piece of media absorbed, and a thought from a run. 

Doctrine: On the desert of information. The more information something contains, the more susceptible it is to decay. Compare a novel to a song to a phrase. Thus the longest lasting things contain the least. So the world of forms is like a desert, where only particles of sound are eternal like sand, and dunes take shape only for a moment before the wind washes them away again.
