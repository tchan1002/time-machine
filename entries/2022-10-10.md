Woke up and walked to the bookfair. Lugged a crate of books to class. Stored our books in Reg locker A015 before Sosc. Discussed the decomposition of a soul. Walked back to ihouse. Went to the point with Rachel. Walked by Lake Michigan. The wee little flowers in the rocks. Rock daisies. Bonfire and smores. Ran to human vs zombies. Had a quick dinner at Bart. Went to our sliced mag interview. Took a lyft back with our books. Ate at Tiffins with Sophia. Invest in a cook book stand.
