**Day 78**  
Independence day. Ospreys in Chicago. Typed out *They Might Be Giants* and collected our first four pomodoros. Edited and returned Maroon articles. Nuclear bomb simulator. Shake doom. Ran by the point. Saw Vanessa briefly. Sat on the grass as fireworks exploded around us. Ran into Julia just as we were about to leave. Hung out. 

Some silver city in the mist. “I love America, I love you.”  
Don’t like to phone home with bad news.
