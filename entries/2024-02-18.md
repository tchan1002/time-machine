Showered, did laundry, cleaned up our room. Met up with Martina at Booth. Went downtown and interviewed strangers for Trackpatch. Martina showed us her place downtown. Ran into Leo and Crystal at the Van Buren metra station. The moon, this hole, the sky. Took the train back home. Ruka gave us some tough love—we’re leaving this Skylar stuff behind.
