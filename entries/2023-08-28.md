Day 11  
Had dim sum with Aboo and Gonggong for breakfast. Compiled some key takeaways for our internship at Qiming this summer. Napped. Dressed up, went out to a pizza hut in Lok Fu. Spaghetti 長壽麵. Got a little cake to celebrate our birthday with Aboo’s. Think it was a nice thing to do, though it made us really sad. Went back home and slept.

Avalokitesvara, a hundred armed.   
Onto Mount Athos.
