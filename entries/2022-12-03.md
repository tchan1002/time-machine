*Ludus calamari*. Walked to Woodlawn for breakfast. Finish Omeros. Aristophanes, the origin of love. Talked through our draft with Richard. We have something here. Grabbed rice and plantains for dinner. Two sentence horror stories with Alex and Lea. Fire alarm went off, and we stood outside in the cold, huddled like penguins.
