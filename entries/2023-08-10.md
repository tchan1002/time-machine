Day 29  
A lot we’ve taken from Eamin’s posts. Gonggong brought us some congee for breakfast. The mythos of this world. Dirk Gently’s holistic detective agency. Devoured some shrimp. Went to work. Earphones in. Return to gratitude. Came back home. Monkey mountain this weekend? Dress up in cool clothes. Volcanic destruction in Maui. Catastrophic. Trek orientation at 1\. Stayed up to attend our trek meeting.

A vision of Malaysia? Green skybridges. Motel, view of the sea? We were very young.   
Just a piranha in the stream of creation.
