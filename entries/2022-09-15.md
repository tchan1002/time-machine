Day 5 **Highlight: Dracula**  
Recovered. Go out and run. Kyoto. An email from Thompson house. Became Greg. Goodbelly probiotics. Dracula, Stephen Moffat. Lake Titicaca Frog. Steak for dinner. Took out the trash. Weather’s feeling colder now. Autumn proper. Shape up for these last couple of days. Dracula’s finale is hilariously bad. Picasso’s light paintings.

Doctrine: On Naming. Calling things by our human names. When did we get the idea to call the prehistoric by something so temporary?

Meta: Looked back at the earlier parts of this summer. It’s been a long summer.

As a blood lord, Dracula has to be a fan of blood vassals.   
Marooned in the cold dark heart of America.
