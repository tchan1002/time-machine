Brushed our teeth. Polished our shoes. Headed out from ihouse. Sat down and had breakfast with Jacinta in Woodlawn. Lumen Christi. Settled in a Stuart cubicle. Kafka’s letters to Milena. A voice cries out in the wilderness. Read more of Vonnegut, Kilgore Trout. Played hangman with Ryan. Tread water and swam at Ratner. Had mango and greek yogurt at Baker. Walked with Clancy and Bill. Was hailing out. Drenched when we arrived in Woodlawn. Fog turned into a sunshower. Radiant afternoon sun. Ate with Fredric. Cookie no fortune followed by package no cookie. Slow rolling clouds. *Picturesque\!* Evidence of god.

The red digits above the pool. Swimming, an exercise of regimented time.   
We fear he who gives us life, because we cannot bear to look at him. The sun, the son.

*Amalgam:* Last night, lost sight,  
Men’s eyes fell upon his plight  
(A boy lost his eyes.)  
Friday afternoon we walked out into the sun  
And I thought of the golden fibers of your irises.   
*My god,* I said, *it’s you.*  
So nice that you’re here  
And so nice that you don’t care. 

Katabasis into the solitude of night. Our fever, hellfire.
