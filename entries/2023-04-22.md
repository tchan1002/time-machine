Breakfast at Woodlawn. Contemplated going to watch the cherry blossoms, stayed in instead. Find something interesting to do over the summer. Call Anne maybe. Learn from Erin. Solar Opposites marathon. Have to write our poli-sci paper. Cleaned our room a little. Vacuum. Slavoj Zizek goes hard. Grabbed dinner from Woodlawn. East Chicago, Indiana. Cave aged blue cheese. Take today as a day of rest. Going hard tomorrow. Rocky Aoki, founder of Hibachi, what a legend.
