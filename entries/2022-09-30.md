Had lunch with Nicole and UWC Singaporeans. Get changed. Ran into Sam Farnsworth. Signed up for Mock. Went to the RSO fair. Picked up freebies. Tupperware and two shirts. Look into sliced bread. Talk to Eric Zyman about spoken latin. Listhosts. Off-off-campus. Talked to Sophia in her room. Went to dinner. Jack and Aymane gave us some enlightening advice. Go with the flow.
