Woke up for Kuvia. Brushed our teeth. Think we beat it—the tiredness. Finally mastered the self. Argentine tangoed. Worked on our Secret Santa picture book for Corinne over breakfast. Went to Religion. Grabbed a quick lunch at Bart with Nicole and Andre. Went back to North and napped. Finished *the Strawberries of the Sea*. Dropped by Pret. Scoped out Stuart 102, worked out projection logistics for secret santa before heading to CNVC. Need to have an expectations meeting with our Sliced Bread editors. Bolted to secret santa after class. We’ve got some serious talent in the club—a staff issue would go hard. Ran to the DSP meet the brothers event. Called Jasper for an hour and a half. Texted Charlie Preston. Polar plunge tomorrow?

Secret Santa turned into ritualistic gift giving. The social engineering behind group bonding.  
We’re massively connected. Our phone’s been blowing up recently.

Know our goal when we’re talking with someone. Show genuine interest in who they are and what they do. Comes down to eye contact (looking at one eye to avoid drifting), relaxed stance, and knowing to exit.

Some people will want nothing to do with you. They will tell you no.
