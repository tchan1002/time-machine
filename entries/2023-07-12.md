Day 58  
Woke up. Went to work. Waited in line outside 阿三过桥米线 for lunch. Specks of tomato on our shirt. Cheeky little chaps. Walked around Central Market with Kary after work. Met up with Ashley, JD and Aabir for dinner at Tai Hing. Walked around the mid-levels, the cityscape winding. Visited Don Don Donki. Took the mtr home. Showered and slept. 

Write about abandoned churches.
