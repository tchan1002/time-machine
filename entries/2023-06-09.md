Day 91  
Took the MTR. Sorted out our documents. Felt a profound sadness about Hong Kong and this summer. Wrote a coolcat blurb on our grandparents but going to leave it unpublished. Voronoi polygons. Looked at Noah Lee’s website. Did our pushups. Showered and slept. 

Listen to music. Might be our only defense.   
The power of anecdotes, stories are our common currency.

Snippet: When we got to the airport my grandmother picked us up. Her hair sported patches of white. She was visibly older. She told me she had stopped dyeing it. “There’s no use,” she said.
