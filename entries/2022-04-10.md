Went to St. Pauls and had an epic day at Forum. Tied at Agon. Won the chariot race with Eamin. Got absolutely destroyed by Gabe in gladiatorial combat. Holden whacked a kid. Went to Szech with Holden, Kiesse, Rishi, Jasper and Eamin. Kirtland arc? Join us for a bite, JT music. Had convos with Holden and Kiesse. Calvino’s Invisible Cities. Karsten Rynearson. Aim to be someone one thinks of sometimes. Had a serious conversation with Amber. Bro please. Alea iacta est. Switch into the classic cvp tomorrow. Have to get back on the gigachad grind. Chariot racing does not cut it. 

“That is fair.”
