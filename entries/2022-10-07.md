Pouring rain in the morning. Walked to Linguistics, then Greece and Rome. Ate at Baker and attacked the British monarchy. Sat at the Reg, called Will, then moved to take a nap in Bartlett. Rehearsed our mock statement. Left at 5:40 for Humans vs Zombies. Met Gabby, the Breck IM Manager. Ran with the human squad through the quad. Mock tryout was a little rough. Left our keycard in Stuart. Ran to midnight soccer. Joined Liew against Yuen and Breck. Bodies on the field, what a night. Retreated to the third floor lounge. Made Commedia. Sophia loaned us some maroon dollars for tofu stew at Tiffins. Caught some snapshots of the Notebook. Been a very fine day. Apple picking tomorrow. Go look for our keycard.

The deconstruction of speech and the construction of an artificial epiglottis.
