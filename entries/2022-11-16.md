Snowfall in Chicago. First Sosc paper, a B? We’re doing pretty good. The Backseat Lovers. Finished our ling pset. Had dinner with Sophia in Woodlawn. About Time. Key and Peele. Watched the OJ Simpson trial. Ran on the treadmill. We’re coming back. Photos from Summer.

We compete in a competitive theater troupe called UChicago mock trial. We are an attorney. Our hair is gelled and swept back. We are Johnny Cochrane. We are going Rank 20\. Ethan’s our man. 

An obsession with Native Americans. Headdress and dance.  
Flowers as vulvas.

Song: Death with Dignity by Sufjan Stevens.
