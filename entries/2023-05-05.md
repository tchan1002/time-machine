*Take a Ricola.* Walked to Cobb. Ribena and Horlicks. Suns out. The Flaming Lips. Girls just want to have fun. 4 year IR masters program. Had breakfast at Cathey with Ben and Isabella. Ran into Giancarlo outside of Cobb. Had lunch at Hutch. Gian gave us some critical knowledge about the flaming lips, grab a notebook for tonight. Walked back to ihouse to prep for tonight. Wes Anderson. The Cabin in the Woods. Cloud gazed on the midway. Idyllic. Pulled away by Adrian to work on scavapalooza stickers. Took the downtown connector shuttle. Walked north, stopped at a target for pen and paper. Took the 70 bus to the Salt shed. The Flaming Lips\! Kapil, Sachin and Dave. Yoshimi. Fuck yeah Chicago. Took a lyft back. Slept.

In the fluorescent, iridescent light we looked up and found God, a calmness. 

Snippet: We want to shoot a film. We want to write. We want to lead a prayer. We want to speak in tongues. We want to have mastery over the body. We want to do a lion dance. We want to be photographed in as many costumes as we can find. We want to be a journalist. We want to learn how to brew drinks. We want to grow citruses. We want to compose a song.
