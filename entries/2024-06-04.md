**Day 108**  
Woke up. Showered and cleaned up. Went downstairs and settled in a north classroom. Typed out some more of our thoughts on invisibility. We’ve got to be doing stuff\! Strange tales from a Chinese Studio. Walked down South around 1pm. Stocked rooms, first day of busy work. Stopped by Jewel-osco. Steak dinner with Sasha and Ann\! Thinking much about food and home—and how the food we cook is a fusion.

Can we sneak in a run/clean up our room?

Always had a fondness for sci-fi. Think maybe some of the most important literature today is sci-fi.
