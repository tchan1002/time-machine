Woke up and cleaned our room. Walked to Calc. Ran through delta-epsilon proofs again. Ate lunch with Erik at Bart. Pillars of creation, hand of god. Took our make-up exam at 2:00. Ran into Sam coming out of linguistics. Walked to Hutch. Had a poke bowl from Paks. Wrote our cross with Sam. “Exeter genes.” Saw Sam cross. Objection, your honour? Fourth meal. Walked back to ihouse with Aymane. Collecting magazines on campus. Andersonville on Saturday? Brunch with Harvey. Hung out with Gabby. Watched Futurama, Moon park.

To do:  
Draw our flower in a carcass.

Snippet:   
“There’s a hand in the clouds.” one monkey says to another.   
“Do you not see it’s thumb, and finger outstretched?”   
As if the clouds were not just a collection of moisture.

Aimless fun.  
Song: Death with Dignity by Sufjan Stevens.
