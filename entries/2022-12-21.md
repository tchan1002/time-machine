Arranged for a dental consultation tomorrow at 4:15. Called insurance. Bought our summer plane ticket home from Chicago. Watched clips of Diego Maradona. 半斤八兩. Max called. Had some terrific salt-baked chicken. Worked on our RA app. Submitted our resume for review. Looked around on Handshake. 88 Marketplace. 

Have a bananoid for breakfast.

Reminded in the shower to look at things with natal eyes. We come from the past, but we are the present. Build an identity around who we are in Chicago.
