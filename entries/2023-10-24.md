Woke up. Grabbed breakfast at Bartlett. Went to Micro. Split the bigger pie. Snapped pictures of our friends. Learn to do portraits. Came back and napped. Went to fourth meal. Met Aiden. Bang out medical materialism. 

The world belongs to those who ask.   
We will never relinquish this piece of sky.   
Images of exquisite beauty. 

Song: FRIENDS by Laundry Day.
