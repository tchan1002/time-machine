**Day 61**  
Submitted our much delayed article on TBMG. *The mind is the new frontier.* Had lunch with Cole, Abhay, and Emma. Picked up our laundry. Met Luke and the crew outside the David Rubenstein Forum. Joe Biden out of the race. Sizing up for a ‘68 repeat. Long day on set. Quinn’s Mary Janes, that’s what they be. Coraline. Chipotle at Luke’s. Showered. Been a most exciting week of this summer.

*To bat above one’s league* or *to feed your floor*, we introduce new aphorisms every day.
