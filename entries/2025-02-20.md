Woke up at 6:30, texted Clara, who's a 4:30 riser. 45 pushups. NVIDIA's evo 2 might finally bring Jurassic Park to life. Googley eyes. Pagliacci the clown. Fusiform face area. Tabled for Moda with Will Hu. Manar came back. Said he had spent 2 months in Saudi Arabia with his cousins. Got kicked out of school last quarter for tripping on acid. We hated to see him go—he told us not to say sorry. Afternoon: Claudia helped us put on a record in the WHPK office. We listened to the Dildine Family.

The sad truth about the apocalypse was that it made some people's lives finally worth living.
