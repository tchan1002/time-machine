Day 56  
We ball. Went to the catapult colloquia and messed around. Reading Trajan’s Column. Onager. Loosey Goosey. Missed lunch taking Roman Life and Classical Art. Went to the general assembly. Returned to Union for a brief snack. Found Unger, then went down to play basketball. Sara Jones. New Floridashire. Had no luck playing against the refs. Met Biya from BLS. The Aurelia passage. Got some snazzy JCL socks, then went to Pandora’s breakout box, where we acquired another pair of socks. Reviewed for Agon. Jonathan Bailey. Bellicose.

“The gator’s name is Dorito?”  
Prompt: The whistling holes of Roman shots.
