We’re good with this shit. We’re goated. Draw maps of connections as we go about reading religion. Motif log. Nostalgic fall chill as we walked to FA. The cold whip of the air. Mapped out our Durkheim essay in FA. The Buddha’s uncontestable humanity. Show up to office hours with Professor Haydt on Monday. Did the McKinsey game. Our first day on call. Banged out Durkheim to the Fleet Foxes. Applied to TBC with the half an hour we had left. Alexey Titarenko. Rina. Stayed up with Vanessa and Jackie watching a cappella in the lounge. *The sun setting over the serengeti.* Applied to Firebird. Applied to Bite. We really got everything down. Look at Eckhart Consulting.
