Did not wake up at five to do laundry. Think we’ll do it tonight instead. Filled out our Senior Bookmark. Ran into Anna at the library. Breakfast at Elm. Catch back up on Rushdie. Better Call Saul. The soul of a Hippopotamus. Had lunch with Holden and them. Currently doing laundry. The time is now. Don’t let today slip away. Hang out in Grainger tonight. Perform our daily maintenance. McLaughlin. 1 pm on a Saturday. Bobby Mansfield and the Wrens. An hour until we have our clothes dried. Apparent thunderstorms. Sky has cleared up. Sat with Amber for a bit in Grill. Ran into Holden and Eamin. Baklava. Witnessed Akili’s epic tumble. Played Geobee with Oscair in Grill. A black balloon. Hung out at the playground with Jacqueline, Lara and Maya. Took the path behind the health center. Wake up early tomorrow for NHJCL forum.
