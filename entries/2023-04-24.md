Grabbed food at Woodlawn. Light bulb fixed. Watched Mrs. Davis. Gathered ourselves. Went for a swim. Walked along Dorchester down to 56th. Redbuds growing out of the wood. The pretty houses in Hyde park. Ran into Emily at the pool. Had dinner at Baker. Walked back listening to 1950\. Calm night. Spotted an Exeter bumper sticker on a parked van. 

Coolcat: Once in a Burger king moon. Beware too careful a curation   
We should never be too far from the water. In emulation of a newborn. 

Song: 1950 by King Princess
