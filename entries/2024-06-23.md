**Day 89**  
Grabbed lunch with Alice. Jewel-osco. Steak and mangoes. Got ourselves a little rosemary plant. Sing street. Grabbed dinner with Hans. Walked to the point with Lina. Fireflies all over the grass. “They’re like stars on the ground”. Crashed the RA event. Roasted some marshmallows on a stick we found. Took a dip. Lyfted back with Derek and Juliana. *How’s your sister?* Went for a run. Warm up \+ round 22 minute 5k. Said fuck it, submitted our application for Pitch Madness. Let’s get some amigo up in here.

Ask Alice if she’d like to go to dinner  
Read wuthering heights.  
Have patience with ourselves. Do laundry first thing tmr \+ grab breakfast.  
We’ve got this. So we beat on, boats against the current.
