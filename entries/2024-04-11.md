Woke up, finished and submitted our macro homework. Religion in the morning. Made moves. Let’s see where we go. We’re beginning to orient ourselves around meetings. Applied to be a housing assistant this summer. On-campus housing would be huge. We can make some money from offering people storage. Update with news about Nick Epley. 有危必有幾. Signed on for Big Think. Went to Target to grab snacks for Sliced Bread. Cuties, brownies, funions and veggie sticks. Got dressed. Went down to the planetarium. In too deep. 

Summer we’ll go swimming in the lake.   
The Redwalls of Chicago, after a 10 year hiatus. Peachbox Co.

Notes from Epley: Don’t think about the product, lean into novelty. Provide minimal information pre-meetup. Prompts are not what drive conversation. Minimize barriers, don’t meet up. Just call.

Feels like we’re chopping off our legs to row faster. *Non sine periculo.* Excited for what strange new permutations come.
