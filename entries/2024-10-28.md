Slept in, but maybe that was the play. Hammered out our discussion post. Caught up to speed. We can write a good essay and hand it in at 5. After 5, we can start working on ruby. Made pasta for lunch. Two eggs. White-winter-hymnalled. Used pomodoros to finish and send in our mini-ethnography experiment. [[10-21 BM Shift]]. Ate with [[Liam]]. Listened to an IDF soldier speak. Saw [[Jackie]] heading into her meducate meeting. We only have ruby to do. It is very manageable. Miss IHouse. How do we have the insta of the U.S women's chess championâ€”Carissa Yip who went to Andover. The director of Monsters, Hiroaku Kareeda, was here at UChicago. We're zoning the fuck in.
