The first Norse cross-Atlantic expedition of 980. Spent our afternoon imagining a vastly interconnected ancient world. Thought about what we'd do to bring forth modernity if we were stuck 2000 years in the past. Maybe we ought to think about how we unstick ourselves from the present. Mocked up a copy of the SB Winter 25 cover. Showered. Goal tonight is to get to bed early. 

Be serious and sell our extraneous belongings.
The art of becoming invisible. 

To date: at least we've achieved self sustenance. We pay $3k every quarter for school and are compensated $4k with our RA job. Given $20k in scholarship and treks we're def taking money from UChicago. 

If we can afford to live on little we can afford to live differently. 
Ways we know to make money:
Scholarships.
Internships.
Photography. Event gigs.

Song: Pale Blue Eyes by The Velvet Underground.
