Took the train down to Admiralty. Hung out with Jasper at SumThai. Got a Hainanese chicken meal. Don't hang in Samothrakia. though Jasper enjoyed his time in Rome. Loitered about after lunch. Youth Affairs Bureau, sat on some steps inside Wan Chai MTR until a masked attendant walked over and glared us down. Ran into Jasper's dad in 灣仔電腦城. Matthew aloof? 冰皮月餅. Jasper walked us to Faerin. Talked politics and violence. The Hong Kong issue. Took the train back home. 

Midday our stomach did not feel too good.
