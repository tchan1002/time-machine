#### Must Do's
- [x] [[No Leftovers]]

Woke up at 8:30. Lunch. Went to Cathey to eat with Jarcher. He's doing CS now. Read Sirens of Titan. Called Dean Hale. Moved north. Slow rattling in the Upper Reynolds room. Went back and napped. Lost three hours. Went down to Baker. Cabbage and andouille sausage. Talked with Raquel about being an RA. Some sense of loss over what ihouse could have been? Moda board meeting. Will Hu gave a rally speech. 1000 cranes, 500 letters hand-hammered onto dog tags. Angelito used to be the captain of a catamaran.
