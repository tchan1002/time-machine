Got back to our room round 5:40 in the morning. Poured the sand out of our shoes. Took a shower and slept till noon. Met Josie at the reg at 2:30. Talked through evening plans, printed out a qr code for our Sliced Bread interest form. Rose helped us make our poster/spinner sign while Josie secured the bread. *Youâ€™re a resident not friend.* Walked our kids over to Aims of Education. Had a brief convo with Daniel. Walked back to North. Found all the RAs in Baker. Had dinner. Took a lyft with Josie to Logan around 7:30. Tabled. We can sell, we proselytize. Spun our sign around. Fig jam was a hit. Split the last slice with Josie. Dropped by an open mic, Seventeen from Heathers. I-House diaspora outside of Harris. Caught up with Lulu and other people in Off-Off. Lyfted back to North. Wrote up a cool cat for the dunes before we fell asleep. Been an awesome couple of days.
