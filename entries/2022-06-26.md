Day 86  
Freshened up and updated our log. Got changed. Lara’s mom picked us up and drove us to the New Haven Green. Had ramen for lunch, then hit up the bookstores in town. Brian Blomerth’s Mycelium Wassonii. Urim and Thummim. Possibilities in food science, mycology, and theology. Grey Matter is a neat place. Visited the Yale bookstore then the art gallery. Caught the Greek mosaic sprawled across the wall. Revisit sometime. Walked around campus. Boola boola. Did not keep off the walls. Lara’s dad drove us back home and we took a nap. Called mom. Today’s a good time for a cool cat post. Driving tomorrow at four in the afternoon. No. 5 Taiyo Matsumoto. Get back on our reading grind. Mind, body, and soul. Remember why we started. Graphic novels. Reach out soon about the job offer. Went out for a night run. Felt good. Captain America. Haloes. Prepare food now. Keep the water cycle running. Use coolcat to create opportunities for social interaction. How do you like your eggs? A facsimile for conversation. Clean up/ take out trash tomorrow. Cereal for dinner, not gonna eat too much. Save food for tomorrow. Finish Wilde. Write a to-do list at the start of the day tomorrow. Coffee cheese and John Oliver. Accidental combos. Daybreak, what a great show. A Star is Born. Pick up a guitar. Will to live. Onan.
