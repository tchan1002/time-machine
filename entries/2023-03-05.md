Woke up and walked to Cathey. Had lunch with Ryan. Compiled songs, memories, and people. Big Yellow Taxi by Joni Mitchell. Beabadoobee. Threw a frisbee around with Giancarlo before our shoe ended up on a tree. Ordered new shoes. Pick up tomorrow at Michigan Avenue. Called Chloe. Went to Mock Trial dinner with Ben. The things of this world. Lyfted back. Called Jesalina. Showered. Called Gianluca.

We will get out of this week alive.  
Some flagellation for our god. Have no attachment. Mark ourselves as a man of the cloth. 

Song: The Moon by the Microphones.
