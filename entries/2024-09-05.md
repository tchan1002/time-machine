**Day 16**  
Took the bus down to New Haven. Lunch with Clark, *September in Bangkok*. Remember eating with mom here. The low hanging ferns and fountain. Talked Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis. Picked up two shirts at the Salvation Army thrift store. Ray Troll’s Return of the Sockeye. Set up Sliced Bread Artist Features. Maybe we really ought to take a break from logging—it plays with our memory too much. Most of our classes this quarter are night classes? Sit in on photons to consciousness.

Secured a Tuesday spot for sliced bread artist features. Run media. @buildspace.  
Research study. Follow 10 pairs of first years around. 20 kids. First Year, the TV show.    
Amaan Jahangir’s paintings.

We say we dangle between homelessness and greatness but we’re really too close to the former and not the latter.

Notes on our conversation with Clark: the question is can we construct dialects of creativity, innovation? Clark says that’s what McKinsey does. How do we test empirically the extent to which Sapir Whorf is true? Because in some sense it is a tautology: if we talk more about time the more we’re going to think about it. Clark recycled us to look into business negotiations as a particular form of conversation. Something we can engage both with. 

*Nah homie you’re not dangerous, you’re just unemployable.*
