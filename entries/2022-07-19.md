Dreamt that we were driving in a city. Maybe Boston, maybe New York. Ended up at a soccer field in a park. You were reffing a kid’s soccer game, and I kept yelling “sub, sub” but you wouldn’t hear me. Chased you all over the field in the afternoon sun. (Jacqueline)

“My dear, what if we were to meet in the summer in the garden of Eden.” Graffiti on a Bridge in Allston, Boston.

UTL: Adopt the journal structure. 500 days of summer. Tent pole structure.  
NaNoWriMo: Anthology. Use everyday to capture an age. Experimental Narrative. We grow as our character grows. Playing with time. Different worlds. Criss crossing consciouses. The eighteen year old is writing the story.
