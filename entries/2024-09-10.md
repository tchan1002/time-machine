**Day 11**  
Called Dad for an hour. Went back to sleep until noon. The first sin is sloth\! Got out of bed. Hopped by Medici’s for some raisin bread. Settled in the A level for our building manager interview. Ran into Ann, Pascal, and Kat. There’s an abandoned playground on an island in Washington Park. Jewel-Oscoed and made pasta at Kat’s. First Via ride with Alfredo, who thinks *we need a businessman.* The first Friday of school will be horrible. Akiyama Toyohiro, fiirst Japanese man in space.
