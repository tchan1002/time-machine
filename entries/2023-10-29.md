Woke up. Grabbed lunch. Pancakes, no syrup. Finished our stats take home midterm. Fear that the grey season is coming in. Woke up hungry. Got dinner. Went down to Rockefeller Chapel to watch The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari with Ryan. Kabuki-esque. Brechtian acting. The organs\! 

The curved walls and triangular doors.  
Some ideas for our short film.
