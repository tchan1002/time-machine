Day 86  
Cormac McArthy died. Donâ€™t lose another day. Write and pick up some sense of the things around us. Cough feels better. Went out for breakfast. Cats on the balcony. Got a haircut. Recovering from some virulent sickness. Love is a Luminous Insect at the Window. Aboo tested positive for covid. Watched Zohan with Chloe. Slept on an inflatable mattress. 

Dreamt that we were grabbing a bite with Jacqueline at a stripmall. Told her we were going to get some ice cream but she was leaving as we came back.
