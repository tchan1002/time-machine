Day 9  
Mushrooms as the origin of religion. Rex Orange County and Upper Year. Start reading and writing again. Went down to DSW with mom. We’re a size 10 for Vans, and a size 9.5 for Converse. Dropped by Audi’s for some groceries. Recommended De Profundis to Indigo. The Crucible of Christianity. Made tomato and eggs. Twin towers pre 9/11. Cobra Kai went too deep. Species of sentient Latin speaking rocks. Bee and puppycat. Called Amber. Going down to New Haven tomorrow. Keep the end in sight.

Invisible cities  
Head out and run.

“She will hang the night with stars so that I may walk abroad in the darkness without stumbling, and send the wind over my footprints so that none may track me to my hurt: she will cleanse me in great waters, and with bitter herbs make me whole.” De Profundis, Oscar Wilde.

Song: Sweater Weather by the Neighborhood. Pluto Projector by Rex Orange County.
