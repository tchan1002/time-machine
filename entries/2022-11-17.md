Had breakfast with Isaiah. Math second midterm went bene. Mused on a silk-wrapped cocoon in class. Going hard winter quarter with Thomas Grant. Had lunch with Aidan and Isabella. Sat downstairs in the reg and talked about corn snakes. Death exhibit at the field museum. Richard helped us print our Ling Pset. Christkindlmarket. Call Max. Had a poke bowl at Hutch. Talked to Isabella. Went to Mock Practice. Emergency landing D theory? Lyfted to Fiona’s apartment with Alexa for sliced bread. Full week of thanksgiving break?

Snippet:  
Silk-wrapped cocoon, white like the moon.  
On the vein-like crease of a dewlap leaf  
Quiet in the night. A metamorphosis.   
In the cocoon—womb and tomb  
The soft white skin of the worm dissolves  
Into silk white milk of life’s brew.
