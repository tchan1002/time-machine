Last day of April. Walked with Anaemilia to class. Positive and negative peace, two steady states. 60s inside the window, 70s outside the window. 2024 DNC a repeat of 1968? Appeal to people’s moral visions. Read through Allen Ginsberg’s Howl and his Kaddish. Photographed the encampment. Went out to the point for ILC. Roasted marshmallows. Minor setback with our essay—totally fixable though.

In pursuit of gold, our subterranean impulses, black lunged, soot covered.
