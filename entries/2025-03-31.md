We're a dog worm. Quit slouching. Met Michael Moran at Breakfast. Rushed we were. Lunch with Daniel Feng. Class. Had a great talk with Oliver Drazky after our Who's On episode Be Cicero. Walked him back to 54th. Delivered our notice to Maroon Arts. Fill out Papal Casting survey. Would love to be on a team with Soph and Lola.

Oliver Drazky's advice for our show:
Bifurcate, if Diego's show is focused for builders post CNVCâ€”
Let's be the person to reach first years coming in. 
That's what we're about.

People's imaginations are limited until you show them what's possible.
