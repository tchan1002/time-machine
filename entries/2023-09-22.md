Grabbed breakfast at Baker. Waterworld. Take human resource inventory from our sliced bread signups. Furnish our resumes—fill out apps today so we can do cool things. Go bird watching tomorrow. Bring our camera. Beautiful princess disorder. Filled out entries for the last couple of days. Update our instagram presence. F’d up, deleted our everything folders. Met up with Moran. Wandered onto the top of Mandell. Played big chess. Had dinner at Veronica and Ginny’s. Beef Bulgogi rice from trader joes. IHouse from the back of the fire escape. Held a container of cocaine. Veronica does cool art. Dropped by Reynolds. Sad boi hours. A clinical loneliness? Did pushups, showered. Go to bed.

Been writing in fragments, ostrakoi. Gotta give the what's up, rundown, awesome hour delivery on the past couple of days: photography, RAing, the act of becoming and producing. Slice bread could be our vision for an artistic revolution. Think we’re ready to return to a philosophy of openness. Embodying Will Park. Fall invincibility. Get ready for more Jaspers—there are people here that will mean a great deal to us, who are at the present moment mere strangers. Hype up\!
