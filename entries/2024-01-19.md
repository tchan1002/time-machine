Decompress. Met up with Eric at Baker—then with Kaan at Bart. Went back, napped and cleaned up before running to Stuart. Ran into Alia carrying the PA system. She helped us bring it over to Hallowed. Open mic. Eric’s Reservation 503\. Emilio and the Ransom Notes. Clancy. Anthony on the classical guitar. Directrix. There must have been 80 people in that room listening. Clobb. Coolcatted. Teenage Dirtbag.

The ethereal twinkling. Overlapped voices like waves crashing on the shore. Or a summer breeze, one current flowing over another. The drums are more defined than in bedbug’s past discography, more energetic and upbeat yet still something intimate. The shout of a young voice that says “we’re here, we’re alive..” Returning us to a childlike wonder—a limitlessness that says the soul has no bounds. 

Bedbug, we’re actually listening to unreleased music.   
“Keep true to the dreams of your youth” Ryan Sanghavi.  
The moon’s an arrant thief.
