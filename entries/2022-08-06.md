Day 45  
Be alive. Facilis descensus Averno. Daniel Webster. The spelling of Shakespeare's name. Perhaps we'll sit out in the sun. Outdoor table is based. The Wandering Jew. Spend more time thinking. Blinding Lights. Our neighbour’s citrus. Lot’s to do. Sit outside again tomorrow. Work on PS Drafts. Thersites. Went on a run. Another day saved.

Snippet: Tonight, the stars are trembling in the distance, and the forest is dark and enchanting. The vacuum of the night. As wretched and hopeful as a young Catullus. Hope you guys are doing splendidly.

Dreamt we traveled to a parallel universe to play protobowl in a stadium. Left our bubble coral and sea anemones in the care of a friend we met. 

Song: Morocco by Moon Taxi.
