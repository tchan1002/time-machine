**Day 117**  
Heavy rain in the morning. First day of Summer. Cleaned up our room. Went down to Woodlawn for some food. Salvaged a chemistry kit. Edited and sent back Kaya’s pics. Night run. Broke our slumber. Spend the next couple days with senior friends. *The End of the Tour.*

Summer:  
Touch a goat  
Hike in the mountains  
Skinnydip in the lake  
Omurice  
Get on the news?  
Cyanotype t shirts

We are on the precipice of great change. Everywhere a thousand voices are crying out their resistance to senseless living. And again visions of empire. Krishna to Arjuna—*steady the hand*.
