In search of eudaimonia. Woke up early today. Sat with Charlie at breakfast. What to do now? Right and responsibility. Moral authority. The Masque of Anarchy. Eye of Providence. Napped a while on the floor of Lamont Gallery. Like 1999\. Norwegian wood. Had lunch with the fourth floor of Bancroft. Halcyon. Ultimate Frisbee. Left our hearts out on the field. Good playing today. Grass stains on canvas shoes. Sat with Holden on the agora couches. Really missed out on the Stulist event. Talked with Will Park about his photography project. Garden of Gethsemane. Calmed down after talking to Amber for a bit. Guess we took an L. Be the good epicurean. Exercise body and mind.
