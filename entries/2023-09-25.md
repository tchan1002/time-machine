Light rain in the morning. Slept in. Did not meet James Warden of the Chicago Ornithological Society. Tired Eyes. Met Nicole at Woodlawn for lunch. Talked Mock Trial. Ran into some of our D-Nik residents. *Far from home.* Grinded in the fishbowl. Moved outside to a stone bench outside the law school. Sat out and.Aabir came. Worked on our resumes. Turned around to find a calmness. The sky blue above the trees. Phone died. We went into woodlawn. Like descending into something subterranean. A primordial shift. Had dinner with Devin, Sergio and Alec. Grinded on apps into the night.
