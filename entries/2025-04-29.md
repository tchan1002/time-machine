Day 27. Laundry day. Wash away our ills. Trace the argument of Ulysses episode 6 and 8. Write Booth app. 70 degrees. Felt absolutely defeated. Drifted into microsleep. Emailed Shayna Beymer. Rest. Dinner in Baker. Miss our good health. Wrote booth app. Submitted. Thomas and Lola. Only behind on paperino now. Remember to schedule office hours. 

Take the W on Ulysses?
Damn we are really paralyzed by fear.
Breathe and compartmentalize.

Pollen clogged. White mucus. Not enough air entering nostrils. Maybe that's the weakness in our limbs. Drowsy, microsleep. Drifting between lands here and there. Limbo patrum.
