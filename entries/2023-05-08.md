Sad boi hours. Arrived at our polisci lecture. Shelley died at 29\. Basajaun, Basque mythology. Cellar holes. Einstein rings, the curvature of perception. Finished Breakfast of Champions. Kilgore Trout, Job-figure. Quick lunch at Baker. Ran into Clancy on the quad. Wandered. Settled under the arch of the Rockefeller chapel doors. We’re all green, could lay down on the grass and camouflage. Take an ivy cutting. Dropped by Saieh. Ran into Michael Moran. Had a good convo with Olivia Rae. Inflammation of the brain. Talked to Austin about the Lumen Christi Fellows. Become an art critic, or at least an avid theater-goer, make use of Chicago opportunities. Aztec Human Sacrifice. 10,000 Maniacs. Went to Trader Joes, picked up bread and camembert. Feeling a little burnt. Reset.

Snippet: Have gotten pretty good at convincing others of our depth of thought and feeling. The acute sense of being some sort of prized bioluminescent mushroom cultivated for a glass display. *We’re really good at it*.
