Got out of bed. Ran into Lekha at breakfast. Caught up. Homosociality*.* Quaded with Vanessa. Laid down. The trees, canopy. *The King of Carrot Flowers, Part Two and Three*. Went back to grab our camera. A rhythm to the flow of people crossing the quad. Catch up on our readings—print them out—read Durkheim in full. *Markets are everywhere.* Grabbed lunch with Moran. Grabbed some slides from Target. Submitted our photog app for MODA. Napped. Went out to the quad. Grabbed dinner with Celina. Ran into Aabir on the A level—showed him our room. Went up Campus North parking to take pictures of Chicago with Aabir.

To have a curious philosophy about living life.   
Be seen only ever drinking a water  
People are going to say things, and many of them will be beautiful, yet few will be true.
