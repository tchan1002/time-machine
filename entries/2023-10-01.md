Woke up to a lazy morning. Cleaned our room. Went downstairs to do our laundry. Going to spend our last day as a teenager writing—think that’s appropriate. Listened through *In the Aeroplane Over the Sea.* Put posters up for Doc films. Walked by a Latin and Ballroom dancing session, people taking wedding pictures, a group of Quebecois tourists. Ran into Norton at Plein Air. Saw Taxi Driver on 35mm with Clancy. Grabbed a quick bite at Bart before walking down to Cathey. Soft soft fountain grass on the Midway. The afternoon sun. Talked Sliced Bread with Josie—covered operations, designed a workflow. Lyfted back to north for our meeting with Joe and Cristi. Make our room a studio. Called Chloe. Made eggs. A revelation from Jackie.

To do before we turn 20, shower, take out the trash, wake up to a clean morning

Snippet: *An urge to write, to capture these dying electrical impulses. Newborn wonder. Because “the unexamined life is not worth living.” Something about the soul that needs saving. The image is shattered and reformed, we say, the image is shattered and reformed.* 

Sliced bread bipartite. The magazine we know how to do. The artist's features are what's going to make us relevant. The ability for people to repost their friends' faces and be like “hey check out my friend’s stuff.”
