**Day 93**  
Slept in. Went to breakfast. Ate with David Agyei. Oatmeal with fried onions. Did no work today. Watched the boys. Napped. Met Moran by the north bus stop and took the red line to Belmont. They Might Be Giants. Lyfted back at 11:00. Made some teriyaki chicken with rice and our remaining cucumber. Evil scientist Yacub. Mr. and Mrs. Smith. 

Skateboarding, screenprinting. Art hippie. JaQ Lai was one of the coolest people we knew.

Counter idea:   
Within a day, the tap goes up then down.  
Green, orange (afternoon), and red (last hour) colour-coded.
