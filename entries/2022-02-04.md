Cracked our screen when we woke up this morning. Did test corrections at breakfast. Dan Harmon’s Community should be the last remnant of humanity. Rushed day. Keep end in sight. Met with Ms. Coogan. Next meeting Tuesday E format, cancel before Monday. Get derivatives and integrals down. Survived another day. We’re thriving. Had dinner with Jack Breaks. Tried to go to Stillwells with Ming and Uppers. Pool night with the bhaus boys. It was a really nice time. Sweet Magnolias. Ego and desire.
