Slept in. Had lunch out on the quad with Serg, Alec, and friends. Weather in the 60s, we meandered. Mariachi from the North window cleaners. Finished Pluto and went down to eat at Baker. Called Aboo out on the quad. So quiet and nice out. Had some dimsum from HKSAâ€™s mahjong night. Caught up with Adan in the courtyard. Started watching the Holdovers. Walked down to Booth and helped Martina run through her pitch. Grabbed a little fourth meal. Called Zara. Stayed up and finished the Holdovers.

Get back in the pool this spring.
