Slept in. Walked over to Wisma at 10. Lunch with Warisha at Hari Hari. Had a kwaitiau siram—starchy soupy rice noodles. Matcha ice cream with Mas and Warisha after class. Talked food, placebo, and cultivar of the bean. Live lavish. Place with a pool? Had Japanese Ramen for an early dinner. Slurped up the noodles. Our laundry came back so neatly folded. Indo needs plastic alternatives though. Napped. Went out to burjo andeska to work. Had a nasi goreng—makanen favorit obama. Called dad and filled out Schwarzman key words. Magnum matcha from the indomarkt. Shower/pushup/go outside when we feel stuck. Link back up with Wesley from bhaus—bro's working at palantir definitely have stories to tell.

Sometimes showering twice daily.

One thing we learned from Ada Palmer re:pope class. a letter can flesh out a person, even when they exist only on an index card. Similarly, a florin can mean a patch roof, though miniscule in cost it seems to kings.

This is a really interesting country.
