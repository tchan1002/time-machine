Hendiatrist. Bit my lip during dinner. Meeting with Fisher tomorrow so probably a good idea to do some reading. 15 days left. Go out for a long run and finish reading the report on the Aleuts. Maintain Proper hydration. Found a very almond-like seed inside my peach. Stone fruits. Tried a “long” run. Had some difficulty getting home but we made it. Ran by a brewdogs. Sont des walkie talkies talkie walkies?</p>
