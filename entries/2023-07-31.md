Day 39  
Met with Michael in the morning. Felt bad about the state of our presentation. Grinded until two to catch up. Went out to Fairwood to get some food. We look tired. Reached out to Kevin Treehan. Look into computer science courses. The afternoon sun. 阳光普照. Went back home. Did pushups in the evening.
