Day 52  
The rat race. The mtr extra packed this morning. Arrived at work. Das Kapital. AI Frankensteins, to be reanimated via a virtual persona. Arctic Shores, a black mirror episode. Mak’s noodles then dumplings. 奀仔, asked the cashier at 奀記 how to read the character and she called us an 奀仔. Had some Indian at Causeway Bay with Ashley, Olger, and JD. Went to JD’s. Snacked on a crazy amount of strawberry wafers. 

Some sort of prophetic dream. Imagined ourselves as some sort of spaceship suspended above our sheets. (Thanksgiving)
