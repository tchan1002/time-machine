Made a screen. Showered. Nice day out today. The movable nu in “αν”. Quadball with Deva. Sat with Holden and Kiesse on the Ewald quad. Grabbed food at Weth, sat outside for a bit. Go meet Mr. Sneeden. Met Mr. Gallo at the design lab. Jacqueline the Machiner taught us how to sew. Fixed the sewing machine. Made a cloth book cover. A real bonding experience. Tied knots. Jacqueline’s coming to tea with us this Sunday. Advisory dinner. A day spent on the Ewald quad. Chucky P and Jeff Cui popped up. Went to history club. Hung out in the agora alcove with Charlie and Jeff. A book of Homer. Visited the health center for our allergies. Meeting with a provider tomorrow at 12:30. Clean up our room. Freshen up. Drink water and go run. Cut our hair, one last regeneration. Pressed Rushdie. Was a sweet day.
