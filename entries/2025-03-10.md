Slept in. How many times did we ask to be transformed. Sleep—Clear our head—Type stuff out. Done in less than 48 hours. Went out for a run to the point. 6 miles to the beach. Warm out. Ran into Matteo Connelly. Dipped our toes in the lake. Had a craving for Trader Joe's carrot juice. Stopped for a half liter. Honestly goated. Called Alice about our CB final. 少年. Called Oliver. Intro the two. Sunburnt! Stopped by RA event. Stayed up and finished Chungking express. Mitigate stress response.

Nuances of visualization: 
Plan month by month, but live as if we have one week left. One week should have more length than a daily death reminder. Don't live with regret.

Love for the Amateurs.

Wong has said he is inspired by the works of [Haruki Murakami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami "Haruki Murakami"). As an example, the film's original title is "重慶森林", while the Chinese title of Murakami's "[Norwegian Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Wood_\(novel\) "Norwegian Wood (novel)")" (1987) is "挪威的森林".

This summer in Indonesia, we will not be a tourist. We will be a local. 

Amigo stranger dates: what we learned is that we need a combination of mutual and alignment of interests. Because conversations always have 1 initiator.
Who's On is the Siddarthan spiritual successor of the Amigo mission. Rebuilding a human network.
