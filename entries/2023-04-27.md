Woke up early. Took the route along Dorchester down to 56th. *In the summer, we were fleet foxes.* Grabbed breakfast at Baker. Moved to the A level. Napped. Finished Kingdom of Heaven in an alcove. Had lunch at Baker with Joe. Ran into Bill, Adrian, Josie and people quadding. Life of the every-man: the pursuit of coolness. Thrifted a pair of green pants from the Stuart basement. Sort our clothes into heaps when we get back. Ate at Cathey. Interviewed when we got back. Cambodia trip. Last soccer game, one man down, think we played our heart out. Reach out to Ruka.

The professor showed us images of chimpanzee sex.
