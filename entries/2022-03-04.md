Maileâ€™s birthday. Going back home. TedX Speaker Apps. March forth. Scanned the Winterhilfswerk check. Finished pies. Did laundry. Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Had lunch with Nick and Jack. Let winter be done. Remember. Holden Quaresma Homo Quidam. Finished the Old Man and the Sea. 3 Months of Summer. Back home. Revive the log. Reading Rushdie ahead of time may be the move. 16 days of break till March 20\. Road to Chicago. Journey to the West. 

For when dawn came, the light conquered the darkness. 

Things to bring back, in a bag or on my back:  
Underwear and socks from laundry   
Exeter hoodie and cardigan sweatshirt   
Crocs and running shoes   
Running pants
