Woke up and walked to our poli-sci lecture. Elijah gave us a lifevest—review poli-sci notes. Sidequested. A stick of butter. Drafted our interview request to Jay. Submitted our metcalf stipend application. Returned the maroon trophy to Mr. Fox, a ceremonial passing of the torch, Ran into Rick at Ratner. Ate at Hutch with Ryan Lobo. Ran into Emily on the quad. Playwriting. Take care of ourselves. Grabbed some food at Hutch. Ran into Adith. **Do apes do apes do apes.** Get our name on the Maroon masthead. Did a minute and 20 on Flower by Moby. Jay responded to our email request for an interview tomorrow. Midnight opened our third eye—mind-composed the structure of our apes report, fill in tomorrow. 

Theaters under our belt: Studebaker, City Lit.   
This Saturday at 9pm I’ll be in this bathtub right here. 

Snippet: The Space Analogy, Asian American determinism. We are not where we came from. Memories severed. The refugee colonizer in Aeneas. We came first as railroad workers, miners, then restaurant and laundromat owners. Changing but always—*always*—dreamers.
