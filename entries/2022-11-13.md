Smoke in the mountains, a favourable omen in the Indianapolis morning. General Tso's Inn. Steph’s voir dire. Team placed fifth. First visit to Culvers. Car ride home. Texted Maya for her birthday. Windmill farm, red lights blinking like a wave. Steph dropped us off at ihouse. Gained an hour back on return. Feeling nervous about stacking. Had a good talk with Sophia about our thoughts around Mock. Self-infantilization. Refresh for tomorrow. 

Shock and awe. Pure admiration. Heart beating in the courtroom. Hadn’t felt that in a long time.
