Met Fredric at Ratner. Ran into Oia on the stairmaster. Calc. Ate lunch with Fredric. Settled in the reg again to run our crosses with Sumin and Seth. Think weâ€™ve got something down. An abundance of fruit flies. Studied objections. Moved to sit with Maya and Ryan. Had a quick meal at Cathey. Scrimmaged the A team. Sardines. Did our laundry and slept.
