Had breakfast with Ruka at Bart. Walked down to Cathey to eat with Olivia Rae. Did our laundry before going out with Skylar. Briston Maroney. Awkward evening. (We lost our virginity). Something paraphimosis. Called mom with Skylar sitting in the couch. Two ziplock bags to ice it out. Made a visit to the ER. Long night.
