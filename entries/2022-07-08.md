Day 74  
Woke up to news of Abe Shinzo’s assassination. Time to return to knowledge and goodness. Got into the legal program in New York, confirm enrollment and get ourselves a train ticket to Grand Central. Meeting with Smaiyl at 1:30. The wonders of Microsoft Excel. Met with Smaiyl. Corporate espionage. Started Kingsman. Mythos. The Kamaliro goat. Non sans doigts. Went out for a run down to Currier Ridge. r/Speculative Evolution. Make a checklist for tomorrow. Called Jesalina. Made Kirtland Merch. Hügé Génitāl.

Recommendations from Clark: Notting Hill. Last Night in Soho.
