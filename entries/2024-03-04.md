Went down to Booth for our last CNVC class. Dropped by Reynolds, then back to North. Called Lucy about UI/UX design. Worked on our sosc essay. Went with Aviral, Soph, and Anna down to primal scream. Flashes and Bartlett. Went by Max P and Bart for some food. Saw Devin for the first time in a while. Ran into Bianca. 

Summer weâ€™ve got to be here in Chicago. One month to figure stuff out and come up with a convincing plan for Dyno. Use the summer to become a lifeguard and learn to drive.

Doctrine: The mind is potential. The body is a realization of potential. Technology is the efficiency of that realization. Take painting, the mind conjures an ideal, from which the hand produces an image. The paintbrush defines the ease of producing that image. With the advent and ever increasing accessibility of new technologies, see the ease by which our dreams turn flesh.
