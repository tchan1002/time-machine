Day 2 **Highlight: Conclusion**  
Pepe lore. Made our long bus ride. Listened to music and wrote. Get some sleep before our early morning flight. Genetheto phos, planned deviation from a theme. Published our coolcat. Sacred scrolls and hallowed halls, we’re making a pilgrimage. 

Snippet: To oscillate between knowing and unknowing. Apocalypse, Ragnarok, Gotterdammerung. Cycles of death and rebirth. The immensity of the stars over an open field, the forest dark and enchanting, the air washing over you like waves. What Siddartha saw under the bodhi tree, and Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane. Words and pictures provide only facsimiles of feeling, though music gives the best approximation by far. The word of the summer is “natal”. Much wisdom gained and shed this summer.

Memento: strive always to be generous with our interactions. Our life begins now, so many exciting things to think about.
