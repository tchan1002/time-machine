Slept in. Grabbed breakfast with Rina. Dark they were and golden eyed. Went down to Booth for an excel workshop. The brightest minds of our generation... Went down to Conzen's office and signed ourselves up for Chicago. Grabbed a bite with Dylan at Bart. Paradigm shift. Called Krist from Hang. Sunset. Got casted for Big Think. Called Mom and Dad. Made hot cocoa and popcorn. Put our laundry in. Used chat to help ourselves code.

Notes from Dylan: Quest.io. Two ways to deal with people’s fear of rejection—there’s minimizing rejection, which two-way confirmation does. Then there’s tackling fear itself. Sometimes we just need a voice to tell us to do something. Scav-esque daily tasks? Bring back the third place. 

Notes from Krist: Figure out how to keep people engaged when there are no other users on the platform. Reaching critical mass is pretty hard. Ask the datamatch people why they only do it once a year.

Build the button. opentochat.io. Put up a game to keep users engaged when no one’s around.  
Have to be here at UChicago: access to a college campus \+ summer programs to test and iterate our product.
