Bart breakfast with Leena. Catch up on work. The midday sun. Had lunch with Fredric and Hunter. Walked to Alumni house for our meeting with Beymer. Vonnegut. Scheduled a meeting with our career advisor. Lot’s wife. Spring and fall. Hung out at the A level before walking home. *El atardecer,* I was thinking of you then. Phone died. Asked strangers for their sunsets. Interview from Linn-Mathews\! Called Isabella outside of the reg. Shame to be on different wavelengths, ask again another sunny day. Build ourselves back up. Ash Wednesday. 

Snippet: Walking past Saieh, crossing the corner of Booth. Pink dusk. Windows gleamed of apocalypse. Radiant fire, like the red of a car’s tail light leaking onto the asphalt. Empires on fire.
