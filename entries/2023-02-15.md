The amber of this moment. Breakfast at Baker. Greek yogurt. Aaron the Moor in Titus Andronicus. Had lunch with Bill at Bart. Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse 5\. Prep for our math midterm tomorrow. Bumped into Isabella at Hutch. The Waste Land by T.S Eliot. John Green’s paper towns. Explained Galaxy problems at the A-Level. *We are the ones who knock*. Walked back home to ihouse and napped. Kung Pao Jumbo Wings and Salmon rolls. Sat down with Zofie and Sophia. A catastrophic derailment in Ohio.

Snippet: The wind howling again on the sidewalk. Here in the amber of the moment—the hour of infinite hope and awakening. Approach again the peak from which we have fallen. Let us do no more of this winding thing that coils and strangles us. Say we are leaving the paper towns behind.

*Alas my lord, I have killed but a fly*
