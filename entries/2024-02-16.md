Showered. Called Sunny in the morning. Hippo campus brought us back. Published a cool cat. Made playlists. Paul interviewed us about Polsky. Had a really great talk with him. Ran into Sasha at Bart. Ever thought about tumbleweeds? Submitted our pre-regs. Had dinner with Isabella, it was nice to catch up.

Happy: Noah Kahan, Mt. Joy, Rainbow Kitten Surprise, Hippo Campus, Slaughter Beach Dog  
Sad: Sufjan Stevens, Neutral Milk Hotel, Lumineers, Car Seat Headrest
