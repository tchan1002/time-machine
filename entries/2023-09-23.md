Went out with the RDs to the point. Our first time at the sandy part of the beach. James and Jeanie. Did our laundry. Grabbed our bucket hat and camera. Went to the Hyde Park Jazz Fest with Vanessa. They ruined Hutch. Late stage capitalism at its finest. Got Saffron. Ate with Elijah, Isaac and Sal. Met Ryan at the MSI. Walked back to North. Got really sad.
