Grabbed breakfast at Baker. Have to think about landing internships for this summer. Went down a Doctor Who rabbit hole. World Enough and Time. Ran through Burbank lectures. Burbank is such a goated lecturer. @h.arr.y followed us. Peter Capaldi’s speeches as the doctor. Consolidation of our associated universes: tchan1002, tobyvfitness, tobes\_photog. Thermography. Skies today went hard.

What makes up the corpus of our mind? Briefly immortalizing—to quote a friend we admire very much. So much creative thought. Just have to rein it in as we study for finals.
