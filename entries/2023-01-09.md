Woke up at 2:30 for our flight. Reinstalled Bereal. Had our remaining avocado for breakfast. Sunrise over the rockies. Arrived back home in Chicago. Went straight to our theater class. Met Isaac. Had dinner with Emberlynn and Hunter at Cathey. Lyfted back to ihouse. Found our earphones. Met Gabby at Woodlawn. Oof. Think we severely misunderstood her. She gave us our jacket and we cried on the way back.
