Day 23  
Elijah in Rwanda. Decently comatose, we need to wake up. Signed up to help out with UChi-con. Mess with Adobe for Sliced Bread. Went out for a three-miler. Cleaned up. There is no “passing” time. The desert vast and pure. Published our sliced bread wrapped, sent out an email about secret santa. 

“The blues singer with the cracked voice is the sound of an emotional cry too powerful for the throat that releases it” Brian Eno.
