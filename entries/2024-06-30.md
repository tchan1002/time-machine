**Day 82**  
Red line’s the busiest we’ve seen. Packed. Went with nolan to pride. Torta de lingua at a Mexican restaurant by Addison. North Halsted. Met up with Vanessa. Met Puralina, Guatemala’s number 1 influencer. Man too drunk. In our country we ride *burras.* Apple store on Michigan. Perhaps the most beautiful apple store in the world. Got our ipad. *Mas es mejor*. Chipotle. Northwestern downtown campus. Back home. Napped. Ran. Laid down on the Midway. Saw Ethan. Showered. Ordered our ipad accessories. 

Flower petal garden streak tracker.   
Today was good, it felt like we were moving forwards.
