April fool’s massive. Had breakfast with Sophie Fernandez. Mad assembly. Vice and Don’t Look Up. Going to miss the hissing. The things dead bodies embody. Vehicle for political sensibilities. Went with Andreas to lunch with the speaker. A call to arms for class warfare. Visiting classics scholar in three weeks. Underwater Archeology. Warm day out, nothing much besides that. Took a nap in fishbowl. Rest up for the weekend. Forge ahead. Do turnovers for CSO. Ended up having a wild night at Grill. Went to a CLS meeting. Amogus cock. Dorm rep elections, again we are in good hands. Watched anime with Arhon—March Comes in Like a Lion.
