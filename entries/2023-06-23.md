Day 77  
Took the ferry to Peng Chau. Spoke to the elderly about nutrition. Met Shawn, who’s going to UCLA. Walked around Peng Chau. Got a close up of a butterfly. Hong Kong’s flora and fauna. Stockton Rush was an Exeter grad. Get back to R2A. Settled in the City Hall public library. Charged our phone as we did some work. Grabbed a little food at Maxin, Char Siu rice and Ovaltine. Took the train back. Fell asleep. The heat made us tired, too much forgetfulness. Showered. Researched Hong Kong’s beaches. Craving some pork liver congee. Slept.
