Quick write, Quick write. Look for a rug some other time. We’re goated, making some good progress on our paper. A Late Night Vibe Playlist. Consulted Moreau’s writing. Chloe’s submitting her college apps tonight. Ordered from uber eats. Food got here. Ate and watched Never Have I Ever. Listened to Beige and thought of Grad. Unifying experiences. Laundry and gradescope and ling pset so we can go out with Gabby tomorrow night. Had our Tom Yum fried rice. Submitted our essay. Oof but we did it.

The 21st Century, the creation of the personal brand. Make ourselves something.   
Objects and shadows lose distinction in hyperreality. 

Song: As the World Caves In by Matt Maltese.
