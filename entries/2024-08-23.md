**Day 30**  
Overnight train. Memphis in the early morning. Yazoo, then Jackson, Mississippi. New Orleans. Sleep mask made our vision blurry. Willie’s Chicken Shack. Fuck that’s good (care not what the critics say). Called Vanessa. Crashed and slept. Flatland the Film. Cup of hot tea, place to work. Dylan invited us over to the Boot. Took the 57 to Tulane. Tulane Bar Crawl. Dylan’s roommate Maya told stories. Slug house. Lyfted back. “While you’re young, work, save, invest, and live it up”, our driver said to us. Slept at 2:00.

Our introduction to New Orleans was 26 women in black shirts that said “all aboard and let the good times roll” in Mardi Gras colours (with a fleur-de-lys for the O). They were yelling when the train pulled into the station with an energy earnestly infectious. Talked to one of them, and learned that they were high school friends, cousins, brothers and sisters that still live within a 2 hour radius of each other in Mississippi. 

“My kind of life went from impossible to possible, from possible to real. From real to almost ordinary in just half a lifetime.” Pete Buttigieg.
