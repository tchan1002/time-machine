Slow down. Breakfast at Bart. Gratitude. Wandered in the reg stacks, lights kept turning on while we were finding some dark place to lay down. 温柔的夜. Went to Mock practice. Toby Dick. Lost to Keller, but showed that even gods can bleed. Nice day out. Worked in the Stuart cubicles with Elijah, Olivia Rae, Ben and Isabelle. Did Laundry. Mom and Dad called. Showered. Published a coolcat. Called Annalisa briefly.
