Day 53  
Typhoon. Wind rising. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed. DCF modeling. Texted Erin. Went out for a run down to Whampoa. Came back and showered. Laid down and listened to music. A delirious ennui. Sat on the balcony for a while. Did pushups. All for those waking up in the metal shack. 魯迅.

Snippet: Ran out into the streets. The city deserted. A ghosttown of the mind. By the promenade. A plastic barrier in dilapidated condition. News reporters. Cameras on shoulders. People made storm chasers. Fishing hobbyists. Some sort of naivety.  

Snippet: When she pulled us down to kiss us, and we tasted the drink on her lips. Strawberry tongue.
