Showered and went down to breakfast. Write out our paper. Went to our writing workshop. Yeah we might be out. Needed a little sickness to remind us of our mortality. Hope that we’ll treasure our good health when we’re feeling better\! Fuck we actually did it—pulled a paper out of our ass. Called Aboo. The Pilgrim’s Progress. 

Fleet Foxes’ Crack-Up  
Do comedy.

Song: Third of May/Odaigahara by Fleet Foxes.
