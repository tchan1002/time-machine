Day 54  
Slept in today. Agon happening at 5\. Got our study in. The Greek Aurelia Passage. Breezed through preliminaries and semis but got annihilated in the finals by a James McCurley of Roxbury Latin, and Biya. Rishi met his heroes. Unger got us Chinese Food. Had a good late-night talk with Rishi about friends at Exeter. Rishi’s got a crush on the Hawaii delegate. Striking to see how similar the conclusions people reach are. “Figure out who your friends are, ASAP” Kermath and Alex Luque. Tom from St. Pauls. Common Tom W.
