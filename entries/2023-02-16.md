Woke up in the early morning. Lost our hearts this winter in three feet of snow that never came. Math midterm. Get shoes. Midterm was a little rough. Had lunch with Fredric, Abhir, and Ashton. That Hong Kong rizz. Limbo-esque day. Sat in the stacks, then ate at Bart. Something died perhaps. Took the long way home. Slept. Had dinner at Tiffins. Caught up with Rishi and Richard. Asked Sophia to be our girlfriend. Marcus got us some duck. 

Snippet: I ask for the clemency granted to the unrequited, for they are lovers nonetheless. I have been walking so long now, and just need a rest*. Amazing Grace, can’t you see I’m just trying to get home.* A little white dog barking at us on the street, the old lady holding its leash. She smiles as if to say *I’m sorry*. Let it rain, while the child's hands are still clutched in their father’s. The ice crunching under our soles, the heart we lose (now and again we do) in the snow.

Last February overlooking the Squamscott, I wished that you were angry at me. 

*Dreamt that we were in the backseat again traveling to another tournament. It was raining hard this time as we rounded a mountain. Mountain fog of our youth*.
