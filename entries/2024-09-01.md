**Day 21**  
Cleaning staff at Arhon’s dorm woke us up in the morning. *Tired, huh*. We had our laptop out, he must have assumed we were working—or a student here. Brushed our teeth in the bathroom and grabbed our stuff. Ran into Arhon on our way out. Took the train down to Chinatown for some buns. Went up to Bryant Park to play some chess. Played Samantha from Westchester, then with Jager, an 87 year old Filipino man, who destroyed us. David, who we had met in NOLA, came to visit. Followed Andrew back to Columbia to meet with Kevin at the Ban Ban shop. Sat on the steps. Sunset. Pink wispy clouds. Alma Mater, grandeur. Kira, Grace. Walked Grace home to 106th street. Took the train downtown to see Thomas. Astor place. Ryan Xie, how would you respond to a bucket of sand thrown off the top of the staircase? Picked Arhon up from the Palladium. Nanxiang dumplings, honeycomb ice cream from Van Leewuns. Back at Thomas’. Conversations: think jazz vs classical piano. *You can’t rehearse a repertoire because a conversation is jazz.* A vision for an NYU quad, elevated like the Azabudai hills, view of the Freedom tower. Feng shui as a very sophisticated interior design philosophy. We forget what it's like to listen to Thomas speak. Crash. 

Saw Jacqueline for the first time in two years headed into a liquor store. She had a cap on. We didn’t say Hi.
