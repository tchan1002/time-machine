Stayed up last night to finish Silver Linings Playbook. Finished our RA interviews. Empanadas for lunch. Crepuscular rays. Kind of fucked up our sleep. We need to type. Conan O'Brien. John Oliver. Watched the sunset. Angelysse wants us to take her grad photos. Two weeks till Mexico. Rebels of the neon god. Charcoal drawings. 

Tweek needs a reassign unfinished tasks option.  
In deep sea coral, we fly to unknown countries.

Winter reduced us again to the child we are. Stripped away the body to find that flicker of light in us so soft. A thousand screams out into the dusk from below the mound. We engage in no vice but indulgence of the heart. Stop writing to die, start writing to live.
