Day 17  
Dreamt that we were playing soccer with Bradley and Kermath. Japanese Cinematic Literature (see. Anime). Golden Snub Nosed Monkey. Anxiety put some of our plans on hold. Get back up. Reinstated the outdoor table. The Evas are organic. Went out. Sat on a stone until our senses returned. Weâ€™re good. Just keep getting back out there. Pacific rim. Pack for New York.

Doctrine: We live in cells with little windows between us. Finding those windows is what it means to be human. 

Song: The Kiss of Venus by Paul McCartney and Dominic Fike.
