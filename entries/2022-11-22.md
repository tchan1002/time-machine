Caught a couple minutes of the sunrise before falling asleep again. Claimed our metra tickets. Made chocolate breadstick sandwiches. Took the metra to Streeterville. Had dim sum with Mom and Chloe. Called immigration. The houses in West Town, flats one next to the other. Mexican seafood for dinner. Afflicted with hiccups. Took an uber back to ihouse. Monthly shearing. Update wardrobe. Invest in warm sweaters. Deposited our foodstuffs in the downstairs kitchen. Go and film the sunrise.

First light tomorrow 6:20 am  
Carving up an animal. Our rituals around food. Aksakal.   
The rippling of a honeybee hive.

5 days left for thanksgiving. Use it to build momentum.
