Day 97  
Cooked dumplings for breakfast. 10.4 for our last term at Exeter? Not bad, not bad. Double A’s from English. Took out the trash. CST is definitely going to be a bit of an adjustment. Went to the Webinar. We’ll just plan things out on our own. Set up our new phone. Propaganda. Wechat’s logging us out though. Enigma. Klaxon. Facetimed Jacqueline. Glootie from Rick and Morty. Make plans for bedwars. Get some technology upgrades. Convention confirmed. Table Magic until we get to Chicago. Talked to Jasper for a bit. Study for Agon. Train to win the marathon. Do laundry sometime this week. Further deboned our chicken. The imitation game. Bereal is hilarious. Antar Dey. Clean our laptop. 

Saving Private Ryan.
