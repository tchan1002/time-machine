Lazy morning. Holden Called. Tried biking. Ran into Rishi en route to Woodlawn. Went to the quad instead. Acts of kindness at food trucks. Line drama. Anne gets here at 6:00. Raining. Slow day. Stopped in Stuart to charge. Three month subscription to Apple news. Return to R2A. Fitness fiend. Ghostwriters on the New Yorker. Went to Rajun Cajun’s with Anne. Pret with ASAP Ferg. Picked up our three month subscription to Apple TV. Had a good convo with Josie. The Idiot by Elif Batumen. Stopped by the wopo party at Josea’s. Had some calpisco and said goodbye to Josea. Met Ryan outside of Max P, met his friend Max. Hung out in South before going home to bed. 

Shed the poor wretch. Unclothe. We cast lots for his garment.   
Anne told us that in Palestine they knew Chicago as *Chiraq.*
