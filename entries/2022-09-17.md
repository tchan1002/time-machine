Day 3 **Highlight: Night Run**  
Taking the bus tomorrow. Packed our belongings for Chicago. Inferretque deos Latio. Pendulum. Find literary circles at Chicago, or start our own—the Regenstein Regulars. Durkheim sounds like an interesting dude. Lectern styled book binding. Went out for a run under the trembling stars. A night saved and a summer redeemed. An Introduction to Thompson house. Ready for the coming dawn. Urbs in Horto. Matt Smith in House of the Dragon?\!
