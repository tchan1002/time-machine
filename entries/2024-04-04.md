Finished and submitted our macro pset. We’re alive and good. Saw Amber. Urbs in horto. Grabbed insomnia cookies for Sliced Bread. Our book is out. Called Arhon. 

Browning was the ideal social ecosystem—you could go into any other person's room and it wouldn’t be weird. How do we recreate that? Widget that shows you your friends are free?  
Do we go with the lonely ones or the social butterflies? Onboard frats and sororities?  
Become a technical founder—we need to be nimble and iterate fast. Chat will help us out.  
Spiegel Picasso. Product design and hustling if that’s where our strengths lie.   
Of course Aeneas has the advantage of being the son of love.

3 things that’s changed our lives in the past year: photography, talking to strangers, jumping into the CNVC. All from 2 summers, 1 summer living alone before college (we read industrial society and its future), 1 summer living in Hong Kong (living with our grandparents, seeing class, feeling trapped). Great radicalization taking place out of crippling loneliness, access to literature, and a will to change our lives. Mythos of Aeneas and James Gatz (bigness comes from smallness). Is consumer social the next stage of fighting original sin (human apathy?). 

To whom we owe: will park (influencer arc), thomas wang (hustling). Marx \+ freud.   
Hustle \+ shamelessness \+ delusion of grandeur
