Slept in. Shaved. Went down to the Hyde Park book fair. Acquired a couple Nat Geo posters from the 70s. Life photos. Clean up our room. A call from Sierra Leone. Wagon Wheel. Auditioned for a Fire Escape film. Weather turning a nostalgic chilly. Ate with Shannon and Kayla. Took a massive nap. Wolfed down a meal before our house meeting. *Always be grinding.* TBC did not take us. Printed out our religion stuffâ€”make a map. Use the Yuen printer. 

Enuma Elish: The concept of sacrifice represented so gutturally. Death and fertility. Something fecund. Qingu the Agnus Dei, they put the burden of the gods on us.

Song: Wagon Wheel by Ketch Secor.
