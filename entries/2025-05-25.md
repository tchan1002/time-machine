We have magnetism. Jump into the summer. Quick lunch at Baker. Hopped over to Trader Joes. Medieval Onion Soup. Ground beef, caramelized onions. Cut up Brie. The teeniest bit of Saffron. Lifted our pot over to Pope party. Got a Temptemus papam shirt. Straighten our back. Quit hunching. Did pushups. Machiavelli, read about the Borgiapolis that never happened. Last two sunsets living in north? Wrote and submitted Machiavelli paper. Marx and pack? Inching towards the end of finals. Baptism in the lake. Pushup-failured.

Biggest aura increase actually just getting good posture?
We should be engaging core muscles even when we walk around. 
Limit looking down screentime, switch out of box.
Choose good posture, shit builds over time.

He set out for the wilderness only to find one city after another. one broadway exchanged.
Armed prophets make change.

Song: Big Mountain by Wormy.
