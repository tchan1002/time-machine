Fell asleep last night. Have to head out earlier. Looked at Ronald’s questions. We should start a writing camp. We’re pretty good. Reading how to win friends again. Getting spotify back has been everything. Drink more water. Talk to kids. Watch American Psycho. Taxi Driver too. Went out for a run. Felt pretty good. Think we ran into someone from Exeter. Buy into exceptionalism. Remember why. Be mean. Sufjan Stevens.
