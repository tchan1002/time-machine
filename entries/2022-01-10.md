Use morning to grind on Greek. God bless Ronald Reagan. Bob Saget died. Met with Micheal about the Exonian. Genetics is some crazy stuff. The intrinsics of language. Some good arabinose. Pub Club. Become a master of Greek and Latin. Some goals to live towards. Stulist meeting tonight at 8:30. Greek numerals. Renders are the future. Render-architects. Virtual houses. A material-free universe, a light-filled universe so when he said “let there be light.” Damn, Adam’s in quarantine too. Resigning from stu-list. Back to ethics? Review for Greek. We’re really rotating here. Fafsa got processed. Liam from Chicago is a human engineer. Turns out the whole prep floor is down. Gotta start rationing the gum. YATTA.

Milk of human kindness.  
“Yet even in these nobility shines through, when a man bears with resignation many great misfortunes, not through insensibility to pain but through nobility and greatness of soul.”
