        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Passed new years hunched up under the table with Chloe. Hit the ground running when we get back to school. Mock scrimmages on Tuesday and Thursday. George Michael is Michael Cera? Checked in at Bradley. Perks of Being a Wallflower type beat. Read through Holden’s essays with him. Did our theater readings on the plane. Objects reanimated in theater. Arrived in Chicago. Hitched a ride with Nicole and Ashley back to school. Lion King. Stayed up late talking with Clancy and Gabby. Met Ben from Chicago. Cut our hair. </p>
<p>Thank god for music.  California, you great expansive discoscape.</p>
<p>Doctrine: A visualization of a sphere of causality. From the moment of one’s birth, mortality defines a finite realm of possibilities for one’s life. Thus possibilities emanate like vectors of different lengths from a center to form an oblong sphere—a shape of infinite density but finite volume. </p>
<p>Coolcat: Love writing these things at airports, train stations, and bus stops. Like to think that something about transitions makes one pause and write. Been a huge believer lately in the possibilities within cutscenes, those moments where I swear we are infinite. Anyways, a big welcome to all you cool people from college, and thank you to everyone who made 2022 the best yet. To more pool playing, soccer dominating, cartoon watching, city venturing, mock trialing, and general trifling.</p>
<p>Snippet of a New Year’s Flight: Flying inland from Michigan inland, spiraling slowly over Chicago, field of Christmas lights. The slow moving interstate and the miniature houses. Through the window, a distant plane’s tail light flashes like a shooting star of parallel trajectory. </p>

Walked through the Village. The California sun! Had a very tomato lunch at California Pizza Kitchen. Maybe too happy. Fatigue caught up with us at the motel 6. Took a nap before dinner. Walked with William. The moon was luminous. Picked up avocados and bananas for free from the 99 cent store. Talked to Ryan. Slept. </p>

Spectroscopy: see oxygen on distant planets! Tracing the stars with film. The European Extremely Large Telescope. Visited the map room with Noah and Tallulah. The Peutinger table. Ferdinand Magellan. Left our keycard in the map room. Up and down sorta day. Had dinner with Ryan and Nick. Impact investing is not the party we thought it’d be. Sat down with Gabby at Tiffins and talked. Laughing isn’t conversation. Went out for a three miler. Inquired about pool hours.</p>

Worked on our Secret Santa picture book for Corinne over breakfast. Went to Religion. Grabbed a quick lunch at Bart with Nicole and Andre. Went back to North and napped. Finished <em>the Strawberries of the Sea</em>. Dropped by Pret. Scoped out Stuart 102, worked out projection logistics for secret santa before heading to CNVC. Need to have an expectations meeting with our Sliced Bread editors. Bolted to secret santa after class. We’ve got some serious talent in the club—a staff issue would go hard. Ran to the DSP meet the brothers event. Called Jasper for an hour and a half. Texted Charlie Preston. Polar plunge tomorrow?</p>

Swing danced, followed, did not realize the roles were cross gender lines. Moved to Breakfast at Bart. Clancy bought us an iced tea at the Grounds of Being. Think we live the life of an ascetic—no alcohol, no drugs, no coffee. Hamlet and Orestes. Went to our math lecture, meditation time. Returned to ihouse to nap. Met Ryan at the Reg. Had dinner with Ryan and Ethan. The Pooh Pathology Test. Went to our lab section. Paper star on a yardstick. Rushed to mock practice, left our charger. Visited BJ afterwards. Went to Elijah’s room for cups. Long Island Iced Tea at Henry’s. Had raising canes from the BJ RDs. Elijah called us a lyft back. </p>

How peaceful to see snow on empty streets, wish we had our camera with us. Walked back with Inhyeok from Voices. Grabbed breakfast at Baker. Had such a good convo with Anna about Model UN, mentorship, and reaching out to people. American Dreams in China. Grabbed lunch with Odelette, our old neighbor. Delegate our responsibilities—we are doing a little too much. Napped. Went into deep sleep for a couple hours. God we’re dead. Worked on our DSP app. Weather next week is awful. Wrote up a cool cat on Jacob’s poem. To dream of Rome from Alba Longa. Host a birthday party for ourselves next year. </p>
<p>Sliced Bread has to appeal to the general student populace. We need “lay creatives”. Become a meme page. Open ourselves up. Can’t close ourselves off. Cultivate big-small relationships within the club. Bonding events start with the editors—make pasta next Tuesday. </p>
<p>At our 10 year’s reunion, can we deal with having gambled and lost? Question we have to answer. Marketing/HR. Start with trying to sell a pen to a stranger. “Omegle in real life” Our greatest resource is people/ </p>

<p>Doctrine: From Aristotle, if one views good as happiness, moral good is to strive to preserve innocence, for a child is naturally happy and possesses an intrinsic goodness—kindness is intrinsic to a child, for a child always assumes the good of others, and gratitude is intrinsic to a child as well, for even the smallest things brings a child joy. But note well, to preserve innocence is not the same as having innocence, for innocence, by definition, is a kind of ignorance, and to be good or bad is a choice, thus only after one loses their innocence may one choose to preserve innocence in themselves and others. At its roots, the preservation of innocence is also a stoic ideal, for to preserve innocence is to resist the corrupting elements that come with age and thus a form of control in the face of that which is out of one’s control.</p>

<p>What AI Means for Writing
In an age of mass media, it&#39;s wise to be prudent about what you put out. What does it mean to write in an age where ChatGPT can deliver ultrapersonalized content to your mailbox any time you want?</p>
<p>ChatGPT&#39;s &quot;tasks&quot; might have just destroyed traditional media, or at least significantly raised the bar for quality of content given auto-generated newsletters. Though this may not be any different compared to the Human Generative Engine. To what degree are we the same black box, Chinese room, endlessly recombining and reinterpreting our inputs? Maybe our edge is not in the sort of box we are, but rather in the types of inputs we receive.</p>
<p>Here at least is how we differ (for now):</p>
<ol>
<li>our inputs are multimodal—touch, taste, see, smell</li>
<li>our inputs are others—friends, family, strangers.</li>
<li>our inputs are serendipitous. 
Given we&#39;re different in these ways, we should have this inform our writing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alt-realization:
For AI&#39;s to gain fidelity, we need more receptors/ways of encoding input information.
Difficulty in terms of achieving verisimilitude. Textual &lt; Audio &lt; Visual &lt; Tactile &lt; Olfactory &lt; Taste</p>

Make a post about Indigo. Derek Savage. Season 5. Los Pollos Hermanos. <em>Mala leche</em>. Get back on track. Finish homework for the week. Kurt Vonnegut. In a dark dark room. Built a resume today. Applied to the program. Search for internships. Productive day. Professional growth. The Nonsense. Got Lexies from the food truck and ran into Shrayes. I’m actually so fucking dumb. Do some research and get showered. It’s all good, man. Risk assessment. Chicago to Toronto?</p>
<p>All my life, my dad’s told me that a man’s worth is defined by what he can do for others, the value he provides. “If you know what people want“, he tells me,”you have them.” Now multiply the wants of one person to a crowd, if you could quantitatively evaluate that, you have the world.</p>

Sent an email out to Jay from the puppet fest. Joe showed us their room and collection of beyblades. Secured AV equipment for open mic. Dirt red. Turn hiccups into opportunities, we’re a game-maker. Looked through Martina’s pitch deck, put in our questions. Went to Firebird and then Fire Escape. Adventures with David Lara. Came back and made pasta for the house. Put on our chef hat. Thursday and Friday night parties with Joseph Mooney this week. The moon hung there, orange. </p>

<p>How do we accelerate this winter, certainly not by sitting around and jerking off.
On the record is quite literal. </p>
<p> [[Nowhere Collective]]: 
Key learnings from existing Primary Customer Research:</p>
<ol>
<li>OOAK: one of a kindness is king.</li>
<li>Experience of in-person perusal is huge to most people&#39;s experience of buying handmade goods  ([[CB]]: initial consideration)<ol>
<li>When shopping online, makers conduct extensive checks to if the item has good reviews, is local, is renewable, etc... (active evaluation + closure)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Most people buy items as gifts for others.</li>
</ol>
<p>Extrapolate from the experience of being at a holiday market, so much of the joy comes from perusing and feeling like one &quot;found&quot; something just for them (or for a special someone). How do we replicate this experience digitally? How do we personalize? Instead of a search function, maybe one is presented with a gallery of x items that refreshes every day? Time sensitivity plays into loss-aversion and items &quot;made just for you&quot; would allow for market. Daily refresh would also give someone a reason to visit the app daily (a virtual holiday market that someone can check out everyday)</p>
<p>Most minimally, a garden is a curated newsletter, maximally, it is an extension of one&#39;s personality.</p>
<p>[[Human Communication]]: 
thumbs up + thumbs down = thumb in the middle? it&#39;s a king - man + woman = queen problem. can we map asl onto a vector field?</p>
<p>Language is one of our rare windows into others. So what does it mean when &quot;non-others&quot; (AI) hijack this conscious melding stream. Do we fear the false soul?</p>
<p>Personal AI agent management systems may be next the big thing. Steve jobs + Xerox Park. Think AI + intelligent homes. </p>
<p>Realization in our way of serendipitous input collection (especially our web-surfing behavior): inputs have different weights depending on the time that they&#39;re fed to us. e.g we don&#39;t think a lot when we first encounter a Virgil Abloh quote, but then we think about how it relates to our consumer behavior class, and then we watch a video about Kanye.</p>

    One day I was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> in a coffee shop, and I was thinking Alibaba is a good name. And then a waitress came, and I said do you know about Alibaba? And she said yes. I said what do you know about Alibaba, and she said &#39;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sesame_(phrase)" title="Open Sesame (phrase)">Open Sesame</a>.&#39; And I said yes, this is the name! Then I went onto the street and found 30 people and asked them, &#39;Do you know Alibaba&#39;? People from India, people from Germany, people from Tokyo and China. ... They all knew about Alibaba. Alibaba—open sesame. Alibaba—40 thieves. Alibaba is not a thief. Alibaba is a kind, smart business person, and he helped the village. So ... easy to spell, and global know. Alibaba opens sesame for small- to medium-sized companies. We also registered the name AliMama, in case someone wants to marry us!</p>

<p>Doctrine: Let the statement be, if one possesses a certain property, that which is derived by that will also possess the same property. So said, a lake has the property of water being fluid. But what is water constituted by? And is that thing fluid?  Molecules. Molecules are fluid. But what are molecules constituted by? Atoms, and atoms are not in themselves fluid. That said, a clarification must be made, a derivative possesses the property of its root, but not only the properties of its root. And as the root of all things is the atom, the most fundamental property of all things must be being. Being is the first state of the world.</p>

<p>Penn and Teller&#39;s Desert Bus. Exercises in boredom—we need more of them. Desert &gt; boredom &gt; wisdom. The death of Tiktok may be shortlived. Such gems in our instagram story surveys. Jackets and jeans. Mom&#39;s in an MLM but maybe that&#39;s ok. We love crowdsourcing—human engines. Sequioa&#39;s back visiting campus. Ate with Tyler at Bart. Doubts of his Divinity: An Analysis of Jesus&#39; last days. MODA shoot part III. Got our picture taken by Maryam. House meeting. Made fried rice for dinner. Prepped for Blair Thomas interview. Found our info on theorg.com</p>
<p>Up against the big boys at Medill. How glad are we for the low-barrier of entry to the maroon.</p>
<p>We&#39;re taking on too many projects: watch mania.
We need a maroon timetracker. 
Ghost in the Shell @ Doc Films next Saturday.</p>
<p>Biden is really the Carter of our times. Ceasefire deal + tiktok revival just as the presidency passes to Trump. </p>
<p>Investigate the paragraph as a unit of writing: how do we tell one idea really well? For when typing becomes analog—something akin to painting. Dumb to think that we thought about integrating chat into our writing homepage. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s something really scary about AI. Ultra-accessible and hyperpersonalized content will silo minds.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Woke up in the hazy morning. Walked to Ratner. Swam. Maddie’s a lifeguard. Sore. Mitchell swiped us in at Bart. Thought we lost our ID Card. Was about to replace it when an email from Ratner came in. Had breakfast with Phil. Matthew Clemson was in our DC case. Tense moment in class over the Rape of Helen. Had lunch with Bill and Rohan. Moved to the Stuart cubicles for our writing seminar. Talked to Tommy about Avatar. Native American eco-ethics. Braiding sweet grass. Eywa, the ecosystem as one organism governed by one consciousness. Returned to ihouse and napped. Intergalactic. Lights off, spicy noodles and root beer. Some time alone. Took a nap. Aymane. Fortnite in the third floor lounge. Had a slice of matcha cake for Ryan Michaud’s birthday. Played ping pong downstairs with Aleksander from our writing seminar. Went to Lambda with Clancy and Rishi. Stepped outside of our comfort zone.</p>

Racer Clarence. A really good convo with Luke Delaney’s parents. Saturday night meal swipe—Noodles Etc. has always been good to us. Stumbled into Vanessa’s band playing at Mandel hall. Walked to the 56th metra station; ran into Avaril, Billy and Anna. Arrived at the palmer house. Left with Ryan to Steppenwolf. The immortal jellyfish girl. Famished. Lyfted back to the Hyde Park McDonalds. Downed nuggets and a spicy chicken sandwich. Cleaned up in a South bathroom. Went to the Fire Escape afterparty. Sprite. What a good time, get to know Finn.

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Busy day, we’ll probably survive though. Messed up on the hand in, but we’re still alive. Goldengrove unleaving. The Jabberwocky. Cohesive Devices. Generative Engines. Beowulf. Guttural Anglo Saxons. Finished Nicaragua research during the long block. Sat with Grace during E format. Cough acting up a bit today. Going to the health center. Took a long nap. Had a really good night with Grace today at the track meet. Saw Will house with Shalom. Talked to David and Colbert. Called Aboo. Olive farm. Today was a really splendid day. Talked to a lot of friends and had a lot of fun. Extremely sore calves though. Zhou Enlai.</p>

Train stations and hazy early mornings. The Palmer hotel. Staffed at the Great Chicago Fire. A muffin for breakfast. Wasn’t feeling well. Freaking out. Called Sophia. Ryan called us a lyft back. Took a long nap. Had a chicken katsu down at Tiffins with Clancy. Talked to Sophia. The sex lives of college girls in the third floor lounge. Sent Stephen another email.

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Woke up. Ran over to bart. Had our editors meeting. A coxswain metaphor, leadership is about bearing the onus when others fail. <em>When the rowers stop</em>, <em>you get back in the boat and row yourself.</em> Sent Serg, Nicole and Adama their photos. The changing colours in the sky. Our arms still so sore from carrying the PA on Friday. Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Went down to baker for some food. Ate with Tia then Aiden. Stranger challenge. Getting a customized chef Toby hat! Our fire escape films sweatshirt so clutch. Learn how to use a flash. Got really tired, slept.</p>
<p>The urge to write things down, because we are too passionate about the self, too unyielding against time, too scared of being forgotten. We have enough material to construct a decent simulacrum. But what does that do? Realized recently that the trick is to do the things we love and do them well. There will always be value in treating people earnestly and holding those we love close to us. We were a jealous kid—on a car ride back from Roy Baek’s house we cried over his little white dog Momo and a prayer before dinner. We’re older now and know it’s on us to make things happen.</p>

Filed a stamps funding request for Sophie Wingland to approve before she leaves. We really need to stop slacking off there. Laundry. It&#39;s snowing in New Orleans. Ate at bart. 5 bowls of soup. Called dad. Need to make Indonesia plans—go work at a mine? Watched Nosferatu, some freaky stuff.</p>
<p>NO NEW PROJECTS. 
Simplify. Iteration is the addition of <em>one</em> concept. (e.g Notes App + Links = Obsidian)
Stamps: have a concise homepage that we can show to people.</p>
<p>Sliced Bread was not the creative project we envisioned. And no shame in that. A club cannot be a &quot;personal&quot; vision. It&#39;s ok for SB to be a place where people come weekly to yap. // Throwback to convo we had with Jacqueline in the PEAN room back senior year, we asked her about &quot;legacy&quot; and she said she&#39;d never thought about it that way. Can&#39;t underestimate the degree to which ego is just fear, better that we understand the truth about why we do things than not. </p>

Got the extension on our essay for Wednesday. Love Tiffins and ihouse. What is best in life? Did our theater homework. Compartmentalize, we’re gonna finish this week alive. </p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>De Profundis. Oscar Wilde. Ernest Hemingway. Fine writing is lost to unimaginative souls. Epigrams. Wikisource. Rhodes Scholar. Though “a writer should never allow himself to be turned into an institution” Jean-Paul Sartre. Nevermind, probably not going to send what I wrote last night. Looking ahead, 6 weeks left in the term. 16 days of March break. Keep doing those pushups. Keep showering. Cannot be lax if we want to win it all. Lily of the Valley. The greatest poet of them all. Dante and Beatrice. A longstanding poetic tradition of unrequited love. Symptoms of loneliness. Make sure we don’t lose out on what we have in our notes.<br>Ride a beam of light across the universe. Thought a lot about writing today. Did laundry. Cooked eggs. Oliver microwave 1:00 AM. Why do people watch Gilmore Girls. Southside Chicago. Went to get Altoids. Tamales.</p>
<p>Snippet: Smash words into light, collide. Gleaming marble machinations in concrete ruins. The touch of a cherry blossom upon the finger of a gentle giant. Philosopher. Machine. What is beauty? What is light? This is the age beyond eternity, where the last remnants of a great race are intelligent machines. </p>
<p>Doctrine: Effective horror movies defy expectation of morals, subvert what is good or evil. That which teaches us morals that align with society cannot be art because art is a rejection of society.</p>
<p>Doctrine: The body is the origin of language, our movements the origin of art. Good writing is carnal. Beautiful words crave to be consumed like matters of the flesh. Words are either warm or cold, and the good writer is careful not to mix the two so as not to dampen passion or muddy thought.</p>

Made and manipulated a puppet with Emberlynn and Kai. Had dinner at Cathey with Isa and Phoebe. Walked back to ihouse with Simon and slept. Make a wellness appointment. Do math HW. Call wellness tomorrow and make an appointment. Be careful when doing our math. Finish Gradarius, do gradescope in the morning.</p>

<p>Convo with David Ma:  In the next ten years, tens of millions of people will find themselves with money to spend. We have to understand what an office worker in Jakarta does for fun. Solve the boring problems.</p>
<p>[[Tenochtitlan]]
One map has always fascinated me—it’s a bird&#39;s eye view of Tenochtitlán. A city floating upon a blue expanse, two roads bisecting it in the shape of a cross. Behind are snow-capped mountains without end. Look closer and the city is a grid arrayed by canals. On its outskirts green chinampas. In Tenochtitlan today, you’d find instead the sprawling urban expanse of Mexico City—no water in sight. How can that be?</p>
<p>First-time travelers to Mexico may be wary of Montezuma’s Revenge, a euphemism for traveler’s diarrhea. Those in the CDMX understand that the city is slowly sinking into the earth at a rate of up to 20 inches per year. This sinking has presented enormous challenges to the city’s potable water infrastructure. </p>
<p>Those who know Tenochtitlán know that the city lies in a caldera. When the Spanish conquered the city in 1519, they also drained it, not understanding its ramifications. Five centuries later, Mexican researchers are restoring chinampas to combat climate change. In an era of rapid expansion, perhaps we need to look towards indigenous wisdom to solve the challenges of the future.</p>
<p>Temporal myopism has created a great deal of harm for the citizens of this country.

<p>Entry from September 26, 2022<br>Dreamt that you were crying in a museum. I held out my hand and you told me that I wasn’t very good at comforting people. You showed me these works of art. We walked by a kitchen that sold groceries. You bought ginger; I got ice-cream. We walked down a set of stairs and the stairs were spherical pieces of floating glass. Reminiscent of the files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. We left the museum through an exit hatch—we were 50 feet off the ground. When we climbed the ladder down, I realized I had to go home.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Had breakfast and went to Ransome with Josselyn. Theagenes of Thasos. Home is the fragrant harbour. Crisis of Confidence. Litany against Fear. Did Laundry. We’re watching a guy watching a clip. Archive 81. Went to dinner with Max. Had a good time. Chinese New Year. Would be a real shame if we stopped reading in Chinese. Set up an inactive account manager for Google so Chloe gets our stuff. History will absolve me. Preserve our legacy. Wish I wrote more Chinese here. 宋冬野. Kinda preposterous and sad that we’re leaving notes here and there for Chloe, but definitely worth it. Talked to dad today. Thought a lot about family with Andrew. Catullus. People symbolism. Andrew and the Muses. Erato. Talked to Annalisa, reach out to her over the weekend. </p>
<p>Heart so heavy under the bright cold silver moon,<br>and the music’s playing so softly to the tune of a thousand lovers.<br>Anglerfish, monster of twisted love so close our skin fuse<br>Paper crane, my first love would have disappeared into a billion nothings.</p>
<p>Doctrine: On the nature of character, there are three parts—mind, body and soul. In these three areas man’s virtue is defined. The virtue of the mind is knowledge, the virtue of the body is strength, and the virtue of the soul is kindness. And it should be said that to gain virtue is easiest in mind and hardest in soul, for a man is kind not when it is easy, but when it is hard.</p>
<p>To do:<br>Write email to Geer <strong>Done</strong></p>
<p>Meta: Leaving a note here to say that in this log, whatever we wrote one moment represents only what we thought then, and that we made it a rule to not go back and change things, so as to protect the integrity of our memories. And since now there’s the possibility of Chloe, you, reading, know that I’d love you to share whatever I wrote about particular people with them (only good things though, in your judgement). And also that a lot of these things might not make sense because they are fragments—very James Joyce, stream of consciousness type of thing. And I included some tags. “Doctrine” for my philosophical thoughts, many stemming from conversations with friends; “Meta” for notes on this log itself (like this paragraph); and “Prompts” for writing prompts. Events in this log should serve as a blueprint if you ever wanted to reconstruct my life. Don&#39;t waste too much of your time though. I’d love family to read this, but I am trusting you to edit out parts when you show them. Obligatory “love you” :)</p>
<p>Meta: Went back to the proto-log (80 days) and the proto-proto-log (Res Gestae). Only if they could see us now.</p>

Bawled our eyes out, missing Hailsham. <em>Acres of ploughed earth</em>. So cold in Chicago, breaths visible. Stood outside the terminal with Harrison and Kody. Uber dropped us off at North.

Worked on our tasks. Grabbed pancake supplies from Trader Joes. Dropped by Firebird. Our snowball pics made it to @uchicagocollege. Joe crowned us with a chef’s hat. Made banana pancakes.

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Grabbed two cupcakes on our way to Human Communication. Attention and WM. Talked with Vogel after class about mind-controlled cursors. Says he&#39;s starting up an experiment in a couple months. Baker with Claire. Bullish on Indonesia. Presented our [[Nowhere Collective]] Design brief to Katy. Next steps: build it out on figma. New sheets lowkey so comfy. 1517 medici. Sliced bread Ed’s meeting. Figure out what our legacy is to this club. Dropped by water polo. Fourth meal—built out homepage. Trolled for three hours.</p>
<p>Human communication. A group of deaf nicaraguan children may give us our best theory for language genesis. </p>
<p>It&#39;s the same lesson as what MUN or Mock Trial taught us, the game is to be memorable. The larger the population, the greater that effect is. Understand the politics of selection. How a committee makes a decision comes down to who&#39;s on the committee.</p>
<p>Our advantage is that we&#39;ve traveled 8000 miles around the country, and that we&#39;ve been writing everyday for the last three to four years. 100d + 100dII = dataset. We have very good data about who we are. </p>
<p>Writing velocity is the biggest limit to our productivity. If we put things on a homepage we have stuff to approach people with. That&#39;s the launchpad. Our life is ours.</p>

Logged in to our RA info session. Worked on our crosses with Steph and Ethan. Stayed till 9:40. The air had become hostile, cold to the point of suffocation.</p>

Stopped by Harper for a FLAG panel. $7000 towards Indonesia summer would be great. Sent out emails. One thing we do miss about high school was how easy it was to build relationship with teachers. We need mentors. Night. Head out to DJs. Left shortly after. Paced about corner of Midway and Ellis. </p>
<p>Good writing is clearly postmarked, has good flow, contains zingers. (in that order)</p>

<p>Exhausted our body. Fell into a deep sleep and dreamt that we were in Australia—a fictitious Sydney. We rode a train elevated above the harbor between the two parts of the city, both industrial. The sun fell and we went home. Bird’s eye view, we saw ourselves walking up an isthmus flanked by bioluminescent reefs.

Had lunch with Fredric, Abhir, and Ashton. That Hong Kong rizz. Limbo-esque day. Sat in the stacks, then ate at Bart. Something died perhaps. Took the long way home. Slept. Had dinner at Tiffins. Caught up with Rishi and Richard. Asked Sophia to be our girlfriend. Marcus got us some duck. </p>
<p>Snippet: I ask for the clemency granted to the unrequited, for they are lovers nonetheless. I have been walking so long now, and just need a rest*. Amazing Grace, can’t you see I’m just trying to get home.* A little white dog barking at us on the street, the old lady holding its leash. She smiles as if to say <em>I’m sorry</em>. Let it rain, while the child&#39;s hands are still clutched in their father’s. The ice crunching under our soles, the heart we lose (now and again we do) in the snow.</p>

The class consciousness in You. Took the shuttle bus to Bart, felt the haziness and clarity of an early morning. Read Norwegian wood. Arrived to find no fourth meal. Walked back and had Kung Pao chicken wings instead. Talked to Victoria down at Tiffins. Ended up in Victoria’s room in Woodlawn with Isaac and Bernardo etc. Sat in a corner until we lyfted to lambda. Ran into the Exeter contingent. Moved to Sig Chi. Ran into Isabella. Went back home with Sophia, I-Hunction part II. Connor, Richard, Clancy, Lucas and Gabby. Went to bed. </p>

Over the weekend, Katy organized a successful scavenging session where she brought makers to pickup materials that her friend Nathan needed gone. 
We should have been thinking about how people offload materials.

Started watching the Holdovers. Walked down to Booth and helped Martina run through her pitch. Grabbed a little fourth meal. Called Zara. Stayed up and finished the Holdovers.</p>

Media Station. Surveyed &quot;attractive people&quot; with Colin. Talked to Aiden Silvestri, who’s visiting his sister for the weekend. Got frustrated with Otto over sorting SD cards at show&#39;s end. Saved by Portillo’s at 11:00. Parth, Mikhail, Maanav, Mella and Hung. PMM helped us carry our setup. 12:05, stopped by Colin&#39;s afterparty. Observatory @ 1338 W Fulton Street. Will Hu, a Hansie from New York, and Leo. Lyfted back with Justin. Late night talk with Adah. On fumbling. </p>
<p>Cool to know that Aiden Silverstri thought we were high-achieving. He spoke to us about our linkedin post this summer.</p>
<p>Think our biggest mistake over the course of our uchicago career was quitting mock trial—because we thought we were bigger than gossip. Maybe these are inevitable frictions that come with an involved community.</p>
<p>Question for us now: are we missing out on critical social connections because we don&#39;t drink/smoke/stay up late?</p>

Went to foot school so he didn’t have to go to Vietnam. Told us he was in Hyde Park for the student orchestra. We asked him to tell us a story from when he was a boy.

<p>Doctrine: Perhaps very early on, writing—a <em>how</em>—became a what. The body that held the soul of thought became something worth investigating of its own. To state the essence of this body, we propose that writing holds a worm heart. Just as worm’s hearts are not one, but pulsing threads, the heart of literature lies not beyond, but within the beating of each word. For the connotations that words carry contain the necessary complexities that we call feeling. </p>

<p>A social theory of linguistic evolution: the aim was always to differentiate us vs them—to maintain an in-group. Cf DFW&#39;s Modern American Usage. The need to learn standard English. Taboo and ostracism are two great human inventions. Cognitive capabilities developed upon this axis. If convergent evolution. Is there another great intelligence here? Maybe the whales.</p>

<p>&quot;I never liked to cut my hair short as a kid. I looked too much like my dad, who kept his head shaved. He was a clean-cut businessman and hated long haired hippies. But the curious thing about father and sons is that they grow to resemble one another (c.f DFW)&quot;</p>
<p>Everything Was, Always Will Be: 
&quot;So it goes—
Freud proposed a unique model for memory in Civilization and its Discontents, he said that the mind was like Rome, the eternal city, always building upon itself across millennia. Nothing is ever lost, like in a tesseract, all buildings coexist temporally-spatially.
Awh and Vogel are researching the validity of a pointer system in the brain. In which they argue that our brain indexes every event that it perceives. Remembrance is a matter of writing down and looking up an address.
In Rome, the buildings are not lost, just the addresses forgotten. If every experience is like a wave crashing upon the shore, do the grooves on the beach really tell of every wave that came before?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We came from a place where people wrote passionately. Sometimes when coming across something from a friend I&#39;d write: &#39;sorry its been so long—I feel the same way&#39;. I think a lot about the tremendous silence exposed in moments like these. Some tacit recognition of the fact that we grow apart and remain very much the same. </p>

<p>This morning, some feeling we can only call a gnawing numbness. Will the Wombats bring us back? We’re in our head trying to mold ourselves again into becoming. A cut-up lip. We write treatises on self, perception, reality; time, randomness, intelligence; hunger and drive. <em>Yolk, Whale, Dog</em> in our head. And outside, the quad comes back alive again. Visions of spring feed eternal sunshine. </p>
<p>Realize that we need so much to make Sliced Bread happen. Even just the question of consistent issues—really just have to get our first one out. We need a team of dedicated editors—figure out how we can effectively communicate.</p>

Tomorrow seven planets align. Last chance for us to exit the solar system via gravitational swing.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>By the providence of a Cheesie’s truck, reacquainted with the smiley-faced grilled cheese we had met O-Week. Walked to Baker and had breakfast with Joe. Watched Titus. Grabbed lunch at Bart with Nicole and Yoo-bin. Went to galaxies. The Ekpyrotic universe. Reread De Profundis. Coolcatted. Met Sophia at Harper. Had dinner at Cathey before walking home. Golden hour, the sun on Rockefeller chapel. Took a nap. Return of the prodigal son. Coolcatted. Annalisa shared with us the playlist from our Fay day retreat. Called Claire. To bed now.</p>
<p>Coolcat:<br> I. Some years ago, I left for the wilderness and squandered my living. It wasn’t until I was far from home that I found the land barren. <em>Father, I say, can I come home now? I am poor and tired and have nothing in my pocket, but I will tell you what I have found in the desert</em></p>
<p>II. Monday and Wednesdays I sit in a dark room and watch images of galaxies and nebulas. Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice. Current estimates say the universe is expanding faster than the speed of light—the ones who say ice are right. <em>To catch each other is to travel faster and faster still. The quest is always an impossible dream, will we take it up?</em> </p>
<p>III. When I think of us, I think of little cells and little windows where the lights go out sometimes. We are not in the dark often, but when we are, we look for the light in open windows. <em>It is not that there is not enough light, or that windows are hard to open. I hope this is the case</em></p>
<p>IV. My son, you say, what are these mad ramblings? You aren’t making any sense. Look at how chapped your lips are, let’s get you some water.<em>I take the bowl from you and drink, so enterprises of great pith and movement lose the name of action. But the taste of the fruit of the barren still linger on my lips.</em> </p>
<p>V. On the way to school among the grad students exiting the 59th street metra station, I walk past the kids in the lab school. In the mornings and afternoons to and fro school their hands are clutched in their fathers. <em>No mind the lost and the wretched, someone just tell god to spare the children.</em></p>
<p>VI. It is said that the sea washes away the ills of men. There is no sea here but I feel its breeze already. Thought I caught two seagulls outside of North this morning. We offer thus De Profundis.</p>

Met with Dan Moore over zoom. Snowing hard now. The sweet smell of paper. D-Hall marathon. Moved to Cathey. Sat in the fishbowl. Called Andrew out on the steps of BJ. Walked through the quad, the trees lit up like stars above our head. Listened to Tae sing acapella in Hutch.</p>
<p>Prompt: Two strangers, a diner, a snowstorm. </p>
<p>Snippet: Laid on the steps of BJ and talked to Andrew about apocalypse. The song by Cigarettes After Sex, and the end scene of Flight Club. Writing here, truth be told, feels often like scrawling on the walls of some fallout shelter. </p>
<p>Doctrine: On writing. In the age of telepathy, perhaps writing will seem a barbaric way of sharing our consciousness. As photography changed the paradigms of painting, we might find writing’s value not in the transparency of its lens but the translucence of its veil. </p>

<p>[[CB]]: Customer satisfaction is about creating structures that allow people to air out grievances. 
Before any product launch, ensure there&#39;s a way for customers to give feedback. 
Satisfying a complaint actually leads to higher rates of repurchase vs no complaints.
Key: creating feedback-response cycles is how we build loyal customers. 
Nifty responses to customer complaints walk customers back in the dimensions of locus, stability, and controllability so they feel less angry. 
Gently nudge customers </p>

<li>from thinking it&#39;s our fault to maybe their fault</li>

who&#39;s on is a massive show that everyone in the startup community on campus knows about. 
Our directory hosts every single person working on a personal project, sorted by categories and experience. 
we actively facilitate people meeting each other. we&#39;re the bottleneck. freshman will come to us to ask for help on where to go. 
april is nanowrimo for our book (draft for publish in the summer)</p>
<p>Practicals: show rests on a website and an instagram page.
Every profile has a well made podcast, an article, and a 3 point blurb.
directory is simple, relevant, has a number.</p>
<p><em>where do we want to be this summer:</em>
spend a great month with aboo and gonggong in hong kong. 
we write down everything about them, make a book.
then we go to indonesia. dig our head down and learn indonesian.
create an interview series that is just about food. Think @dinodnsr
sample, catalogue flavors that we might bring back home. 
hit up and record adventures. be the coolest person alive.</p>
<p><em>where do we want to be senior year</em>
We live in a studio apartment that functions as bachelor pad, photo studio, and restaurant. 
We host dinners (+1 club) inviting our friends to dine with chef Toby menus. Think Will Hu.
Who&#39;s on is no longer a one person project, we are a team producing excellent content. 
What&#39;s more, who&#39;s on? is an investment fund—a patron of the arts. Think Diego Scanlon.
People jostle to come on the show, people jostle for our funding. 
We also double as a scout for a VC: dorm room fund? Talk to Aaron Pickard. </p>
<p><em>where do we want to be after grad:</em>
living in the bay/ somewhere in san francisco. talking to brilliant people. 
our nose in everybody&#39;s business. we&#39;re the ultimate &quot;I know a guy guy&quot;
VC, something something, creative director, something something.

The goals of the proletariat class, represented by the Communists, can only be achieved through the attainment of class consciousness, radical revolution and the overtaking of political supremacy.

What will they say of us? (c.f Todd Hearon&#39;s Roman Room in Poetry Issue June 2008)
3 Jumps to make our name (1st jump in college. 2nd jump after we sell our first company. 3rd jump in old age)</p>
<p>If we&#39;re not convinced of our ability to metamorphize, look back at 3 years ago when we first started writing. Each day is one letter to ourselves.</p>
<p>&#39;The admission process is simply a psychological screening to identify these future high achievers. Unusual risk-taking at a young age—coupled with demonstrated competence through test scores, grades, and extracurriculars—are indicators of future success. I knew that admission officers would identify that, consciously or subconsciously, and that I could beat the odds placed against me because I’m white.&quot;— Daniel Schmidt.</p>

<p>Doctrine: On goodness. If things that last are better than the things that don’t, and things that are constant are more true than the things that change, the ultimate good is everlasting. Now consider that men, the agents of goodness, are not everlasting. How then can the ultimate good exist? The ultimate good must therefore be the idea of goodness itself. For the idea of goodness, innate, shines like an eternal beacon upon the earth and guides lost souls through dark forests. </p>
<p>Doctrine: On beauty. What makes beauty good? Beauty is good because it arouses in all of us an innate appreciation or happiness. But now, is goodness universal when one thing can seem beautiful to one but not the other? Or is the ultimate beauty, which appeals to all, thus universal? And is beauty more appreciated better than other forms of beauty less appreciated? Should there be more weight placed upon some evaluations of beauty than on others? Let’s even take the reverse. Is there beauty in things unimaginable, unable to be expressed, say divinity? Or even, is that the greatest beauty?</p>

Showed mom El Cardena. Walked around the historic center, by the Palacio Nacional and the ruins of the old temple. The sun was blinding. Made it to the post office before our eyes closed up. Recuperated with mom in a coffee shop opposite Bella Artes. Sipped on some horchata. Passed through Chinatown on our way back to the hotel. Grabbed a last meal of various tacos close to Chinatown. Met Trek people at La Sirloneria. Sent mom off to her uber. Recouped. Went to bed.</p>

So many people from the past drifting back into view: Joe Yu, Austin Liu, Matthias Jurado, our roommate Dimitri Zarmakoupis, Sebastian Bigar Van, Eric Han, Frank Zhou. Wonder how they are?

<p>Yan kept a football shaped pocket pussy in his room, along with a head scratcher. It was the last time we ever made a your mom joke, after Yan told us that his mom died that month. Called him our sophomore year of high school, he was at Cranberry academy turning his life around. Apparently at the top of his class then.</p>
<p>For Mustafa, our roommate from Egypt, our first winter in Southborough was the first time he saw snow. He went out and spent hours sledding down the hill. Came back with his hands thoroughly red. &quot;It&#39;s cold&quot; &quot;you don&#39;t say!&quot;</p>
<p>Played soccer with Sebastian Bigar Van, who never did hustle. Always last to leave the field, sunset we would leave before the Canada geese retake the field. Dimitri Zarmakoupis definitely sold brownies out of our room.</p>

Beauty as the most universal sign of good and ugliness as the most universal sign of evil. Finished Jekyll and Hyde. Hyde Park. Went out to buy groceries with mom. Talked to Frank. Gothic literature. The Stranger, what an edgelord book. The glow of the screen is doubly bright in front of a camera. Italo Calvino. Read novels for language, we can absorb information in other ways. Piraeus, an epic. Inherit the wind, the putting together of the bible and the origin of species. The Republic as a defense of Socrates. Tom Brady’s Back? Meeting Daniel tomorrow in New Haven. Wake up early.

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Morning brought by the sounds of two birds. Walked through the streets of Rome and stopped at a coffee shop down the alleyway of a church. An icon of Mary or the queen. The Colosseum bathed in daylight down the street. White umbrella canopy over a thatch-weaved table. A salmon sandwich, a cup of cappuccino, and a glass of orange juice.</p>
<p>From our notes:</p>
<p>Rome, cobble street road<br>black tiled stones<br>the little green grass growing<br>through the tunnel to the<br>fountain of marble<br>poseidon over the waves<br>his staff perhaps once a trident<br>two horses wrestled by satyrs<br>and an olive tree<br>its fragile leaves<br>encased in soft marble</p>
<p>up the spanish steps<br>past a pine tree<br>to find the repurposed obelisk<br>calling some scene of the dead<br>and bird headed-horus</p>
<p>by a small fountain lie the last address<br>of john keats</p>
<p>passed a pizzeria with its christmas decor persisting<br>thought these beige teddy bears hanging were made of marble</p>
<p>the pantheon popped up out of an alleyway<br>so we wound past the corinthian columns<br>to find the streaked marble<br>pentimento on pentimento, religion covering religion,<br>the solemn oculus of the marble dome<br>contained our great silence </p>
<p>six columns of varying erosion surround<br>a circular stage. half a mural<br>compose an antique garden scene<br>where perhaps a satyrs soft pipes played</p>
<p>Thrift stores are where we put on funny hats and laugh.</p>
<p>Arena from <em>harenae,</em> because sand once covered the wooden floor of the Colosseum, now rotten away to reveal deep trenches. </p>
<p>What I find really interesting about the ruins are the birds.</p>
<p>On a Roman night,<br>When a star falls<br>the coming wave rises to meet it<br>and in the immensity of love<br>the two are shattered into each other. </p>
<p>Graffiti on old city walls,<br>as if one grew over another’s bones,<br>or a tree grew over another’s roots,<br>Just that the two are lovers.</p>

Personal productivity:
Applying what we&#39;ve learned from attention and wm.
2 key facts: 1. we can only do one task at a time, 2. we can only hold three things in working memory</p>
<p>We&#39;ve won ourselves another week by surviving our flight back. 
Another set of productive and unproductive triggers at home.
Productive triggers: running and showering. (moving outside breeds thought)
Unproductive triggers: spending too much time on our bed right when we get back. Bed after dinner is half the day gone.

<p>[[Visualize]] Thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the game is just to be way more thoughtful than everyone else, the key is to think in a structured way. This is sustained attention, planning, systems.</li>
<li>If there&#39;s one thing that our education has taught us, it is how to take credit for the work of others. To work off of what we don&#39;t have is leverage. Owe a bank a hundred dollars, you&#39;re broke, owe a bank a million dollars, you&#39;re something.</li>
<li>Have this inform the design of [[Who&#39;s On?]]. How do we keep ourselves in the minds of the people we help introduce?</li>
<li>Three things the matchmaker cares about:<ul>
<li>having both matches come away with a good interaction (need for followup)</li>
<li>having both matches be genuinely grateful for the matchmaker (take credit)</li>

</li>
<li>Something about us, that Will Hu put well, sometimes we&#39;re genius, sometimes we&#39;re goofy. If we&#39;re two faced, stretched across stable and unstable eras like the aliens in the three body problem. Use systems to make use of our stable eras, plan around unstable eras.</li>

<p>Our thoughts on AI: implementation vs innovation. we are less worried about AGI/ASI threats due more than how existing AI will influence human behavior towards world-ending scenaros (AI weaponization, development of bioweapons, etc...) We believe that the next stage in AI model development are economically feasible small language models trained on human expert knowledge, e.g in cancer screening or air traffic control. Projections: 3-5 years human expert knowledge, 50-100 years human personal knowledge. Change-makers will be the ones who own human data/or can elicit it through monopoly over interfaces. </p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Gratitude. Lunch with the dorm. Mr. Rick Deckard or Mr. R. Descartes? Sociobiology in motion. Mumtaz and India, born at Midnight. The dropping of two atomic bombs. Popped off with that Oppenheimer quote. Had an awkward conversation with Sophie. Dorm lunch. The Pursuit of Happiness. Looked over Greek. We get to talk about taxes. 333 Mechanical. The humming of the void. Mr. Sandman. Napped a while in Agora after Greek. Packed some tampons. Dancing in the Moonlight. Stayed in Agora for quite a bit. Sat with Jacqueline and Maya. Played spoons with a bunch of seniors tonight in Grill. Read some 40 pages of Rushdie today? We’re popping off. Give thanks. Make our gratitude journal post. Call aboo. Made the 30,000 mark. </p>
<p>The abrasive reality of human relationships hides behind the tyrannical monotony of a million “how’s your days” It makes every breath a gasp for existence. </p>
<p>“Super out of the blue here,<br>But I had a lot of fun packing tampons today<br>Go follow this gratitude journal of mine.”</p>
<p>Coolcat: “To you all good humans:</p>
<p>For a long while, I was lost in a bad place. Many of you know this already. I’m saying it again not to worry y’all, but to express how important y’all have been to me. It is not an exaggeration when I say that the twelve of you helped me survive this past year. I am proud to say that it has changed recently—I am in a better place now. </p>
<p>This positive development could’ve happened on the volleyball courts last week, or this afternoon in grill. It does not matter. What matters are the significant changes that this recent development has prompted in my thoughts, and very practically, thoughts surrounding the nature of this account. </p>
<p>I would like to note here that your reading of this message right now is a very deliberate choice. The classic Greek rule of morality can be summed up by the statement: “help your friends and hurt your enemies.” When I was lost in my bad place, it was important for me, like the Greeks, to discriminate between “friend” and “enemy”. </p>
<p>To roll it back a little, I didn’t have “enemies” who were out to get me, but I definitely felt that certain people had hurt me. Even for the vast majority of people who had not hurt me, differences existed between those who I had friendly interactions with and those with whom I had a deeper connection. </p>
<p>Not to get too weird about it, but there was a purgatorial nature to the place I was lost in. I felt overcast by a primal instinct—a need to emphasize distinctions between “friends”, “acquaintances”, and “enemies”. It was as if the construction and maintenance of such a hierarchy was necessary to my survival. I had that in mind when I created this account as a way for me to share my thoughts with only those who I trusted most. For what it’s worth, the twelve of you made the cut. </p>
<p>I’m admitting this because I’m in a better place now, and I no longer feel a need to maintain a hierarchy. I’m glad, because frankly, it was a deeply pessimistic view of human relationships. One does not need to enforce a hierarchy in order to recognize how special his closest friendships are. </p>
<p>With all that said, I’m hoping to open this account up. There are so many people on this campus with whom I have meaningful interactions everyday that I have to thank. I may not know them as well and I may not be that close to them, but that should not limit my gratitude for what they share with me. I understand that now.</p>
<p>Know that y’all who are reading this now are the OGs, and thank you all so much for your friendship. Looking forward to growing up together with you all.”</p>

Senator Cory Booker spoke for 25 hours. Took Fred&#39;s invitation to Boka. Diana drove. Sat next to Warwick. 8 course meal. Devil in the details. Raced back to make tacos.</p>
<p>What Daniel Feng, Oliver, and Matteo are all telling us:

&quot;Stay clear headed, keep working&quot; re: Oliver Drazky.</p>
<p>OpenWorm is constructing a digital twin of the c. elegans nematode, down to the molecule. First virtual animals coming 2026.</p>
<p>Boka thoughts. 
Mushroom tempura: crunchy good start.
Foie gras on brioche, umeboshi: strong but good.
Tuna crudo: the sliced onion on top was impeccable, good crunch, yuzu sauce was goated.
Asparagus: such creamy sauce for the best parts of the asparagus.
Tortellini: the filling was insane. so hits the spot.
Tasmanian ocean trout: the sauce with roe was so rich, the trout also just melts in your mouth. loved the little radish cubes? nice refreshing texture.
Venison: very juicy, too bad we had to finish it so fast. 
2 deserts did not have.
Bread was really nice.</p>
<p>In terms of drinks, loved the smoked citrus black tea—tasted a little like ginseng.
The spirit-free wines were cool to drink. </p>
<p>Decor wise, loved the accented low lighting. Little ceramic cupped candles, flowers engraved. Ceiling panels were also nicely floral, reminiscent of New Haven Union Station.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Put our laundry in. Grabbed breakfast at Woodlawn with Zofie. Reconstructed yesterday’s entry. Drafted a monstrous coolcat in the third floor lounge. Jules Breton’s Song of the Lark. <em>What is a lark?</em> Walked out into the afternoon sun. <em>I think we danced</em>, on a recommendation from Isabella. Perfect day for quadding. Caught a football across the quad, classic college moment, though we knew Ryan and Alan, and asked them to throw it. Grabbed dinner at Baker with Erin, Sophia and Zofie. Had a mochi donut at the boba place by North. The friendship paradox. Walked back with Sophia and sat by the Masaryk statue for a little while. Napped. Take a shower. Grabbed a crispy Jumbo wing from Tiffins. Called Jasper. Had our Floridian Avocado. It looked like a big egg with its pit exposed.</p>
<p>Coolcat: We appropriated the Vonnegut quote: “Here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of the moment. There is no why.” Before learning that it was about the horrors of war, we put honey in place of tree sap—thought of amber not as moments inevitably preserved, but moments grateful to be preserved. We continue in our appropriation. A real joy reading Vonnegut lately, realized it is a sort of echolalia. We borrow things we like from the people around us and become similar. So we’ve taken on a love of the midwest and the City of Big Shoulders—via Clancy, via Anne, via Vonnegut. I will not forget, on a drive back from Indianapolis, the slow moon rising over the blue night. And passing a wind farm, how the night concealed the white turbines so that their red blinking lights formed waves in the distance… Via, via, via, which of course means roads.</p>

<p>Browning was the ideal social ecosystem—you could go into any other person&#39;s room and it wouldn’t be weird. How do we recreate that? Widget that shows you your friends are free?<br>Do we go with the lonely ones or the social butterflies?

Product design and hustling if that’s where our strengths lie.<br>Of course Aeneas has the advantage of being the son of love.</p>
<p>3 things that’s changed our lives in the past year: photography, talking to strangers, jumping into the CNVC. All from 2 summers, 1 summer living alone before college (we read industrial society and its future), 1 summer living in Hong Kong (living with our grandparents, seeing class, feeling trapped). Great radicalization taking place out of crippling loneliness, access to literature, and a will to change our lives. Mythos of Aeneas and James Gatz (bigness comes from smallness). Is consumer social the next stage of fighting original sin (human apathy?). </p>
<p>To whom we owe: will park (influencer arc), thomas wang (hustling). Marx + freud.<br>Hustle + shamelessness + delusion of grandeur</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Laid in bed, our arms sufficiently sore. Walked to Woodlawn. Had a good convo with Jack Monday. Discussed our winter quarter cryptic coolcat, a record of our cerebral life. Questioned Pascal’s Wager. Your Hand by Paul Celan. Christopher Smart. Gilgamesh tonight. Might go play a hutch game. Grabbed lunch at Baker. Did a crossword puzzle with Alan’s friends. Walked to the reg, ran into Eric. More sightings of other survivor cast members as of late. Glitch in the A level milk tea vending machine. <em>All for a dollar fifty!</em> Walked past all the milk tea sprawled across Adan’s table after being informed by Bernardo. Moved to Saieh. Get more water in our system, abstain from milk. Drafted our first Chinese coolcat. Went to Gavin house for Gilgamesh. Breaking bread with the dead. Book well-inked, book well-loved. Grabbed a Dama rice bowl. Borrowed a sewing kit from Will and sewed up our pants. A copy of Augustine’s confessions. Helped Jasper with his MUN app. </p>
<p>四月的雨有五月天的陪伴. Mayday, Jay Chou. </p>
<p>Meta: Take our journal as a marination of the mind—a training ground for our writing. Thus take coolcat to be the collection and transformation of fragments into intelligible pieces. Took a look at Res-Gestae, our proto-proto-log. We were talking about 1 percent changes then. They happened. </p>
<p>Notes from a conversation with Jack Monday:<br>A schema for our March 1st Coolcat. Parable of the prodigal son, Jesus in the desert, heat death of the universe, Robert Frost’s Fire and Ice, Frank Sinatra’s The Impossible Dream (The Quest), Don Quixote, Manichaeism, bodies as cells, John 1:5, Hamlet, Oscar Wilde’s <em>De Profundis</em>, “Mad Ramblings” = “Fruit of the Barren” = “Truth in the Desert”, <em>Iphigenia.</em><br>Following a literary tradition from Catullus from Callimachus from the Bucolic poets, erudite, learned, concise. This mixed with the witty, referential, layered, cryptic nature of modernism, Joycean perhaps as in <em>Finnegan’s Wake</em>. </p>
<p>We reach the same ideas through different avenues. The division of our consciousness, the inability for us to know each other, reached by the religious understanding of Manichaeism, by the gospel of John, but also by the Hard Problem of Consciousness.</p>
<p>Doctrine: A love for letters, writing for which purpose is self contained and expressed by the words “Dear —”. On a visit to the art institute with Anne in the fall, mused on Renaissance art and the orthodox iconography in which Jesus was really decrepit. Thought that these pieces were art made for a public purpose, whose religious meaning were well-contained and well-expressed. Something missing from modern art, because the personal purpose of the modern artist is often much too concealed behind the abstraction of their media. This opaqueness of modern art renders them, sadly, meaningless. </p>
<p>In the south of France, in a yellow wallpapered room with a bed and an empty white bookshelf, we thought of death. Dreaded the horrible nothingness. Did not think of heaven, had no conception of god. We grew up godless. </p>
<p>Woke up sufficiently sore today. Have been breaking our body every day now. Some sort of flagellation for our god. Something to mark ourselves as a man of the cloth. Monkhood was your suggestion (you thought of the bowl-cut Catholics, I thought of the bald-headed Tibetans). I took on both, but did nothing to my hair.</p>

<p>Notes from Dylan: Quest.io. Two ways to deal with people’s fear of rejection—there’s minimizing rejection, which two-way confirmation does. Then there’s tackling fear itself. Sometimes we just need a voice to tell us to do something. Scav-esque daily tasks? Bring back the third place. </p>

Ate with Guido. Talked about the node map. Called Chloe a couple hours. Cleaned up our skateboard. Baking soda paste to fight rust. Pushup-failure. Went out for a run. Chicken at fourth meal. Totally just tired, get up tmr and publish Colin&#39;s article + write up memos.</p>
<p>Took running to realize that we are much too slow. Filmed Matteo and Kai&#39;s (P)rind video and Matteo got it out under the hour. To prep for indonesia, just start rolling. Nothing limiting our time but our negligence.</p>
<p>2 big plays:</p>
<ul>
<li>[[Webapp Ideas]]: precursor to the node map, a chain game where people +1 to form a chain. invite via text. xx joined your chain. everyone is only shown the current 5 section, and the game is to invite someone new so that it does not double back. kind of like snake, or an ouroboros.</li>
<li>interview seniors with the format &quot;hi, my name is x, my favorite memory at uchicago is x. I&#39;m tagging x&quot; form that chain with 100 people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Farnese playbook: 
Borgias is Lawrence, della Rovere is Tedesco, we are Benitez.</p>
<p>Guidelines:
Need to be clear what each player wants.
We&#39;re underestimated—no one&#39;s our enemy, so don&#39;t make any.
We can prove very useful to people, even rivals. 
Start by committing to one side (Borgias) while entertaining others. 
Be open.</p>
<p>Zero day:
Find out who has cardinal in pectore through letters
On his deathbed the last pope made us cardinal for our service 
Spread that story so that it seems legitimate
Make it so that we just need to find the cardinal in pectore card
Church officials to supply the card
We need Cybo (the sons) to confirm the story/forge signature
Powerful cardinals (Borgias) to confirm our cardinalship because they think they&#39;ll have our vote</p>
<p>By 1st session:
Get our cardinal in pectore
Become cardinal so that people start to take our vote seriously.</p>

Metamorphosis, pupation of value, congealed labour from physical to imaginary, commodity to money in sale-purchase cycles. // As if transubstantiation. Bread and wine to body and blood of Christ. Moved through faith between realms physical and metaphysical. // Both or neither? Are we cannibals or are we not? Continuous oscillations. No stopping. Always becoming. Becoming unto becoming. // Money-thing-money-thing. metempsychosis this recycling of souls.</p>

Sliced Bread meeting. Really stayed up until 2am to map out how 35 cardinals are going to vote.</p>
<p>Notes from Firas
Firas and Sawiros are building Haldune, an After Action Report synthesizer. 
They believe not in AI but IA—intelligence amplified.
Firas asked questions about readership—we should have a good answer for this
Firas thinks we should put up posters telling people about our show.
Firas also suggested that we could work with the Maroon by putting in a startups column</p>
<p>Notes on [[Papam]]
Borgias is lowkey trying to fix the vote
Will bribe our sister to change the votes
Borgias doesn&#39;t know how votes work
Get the 45k to restructure, tell our sister to say no
owe leo de medici 60k
borgias knows everything, including our finances.
lock down the kitchen, raise the funds
They have the orsinis on board.</p>
<p>Need to get our sister on our side to say no
say yes to not arouse suspiion from leo demedici</p>
<p>Ask ourselves what the kitchen wants. 
Cookmaster controls the exchange of most information.
If we shut that down we can get a monopoly.</p>

Ran into Ms. Komarek inspecting a water fountain on the quad. The word of the day is idle. Covid getting around. Cut our hair. Latin Study at 4. Took a nap. Revenge of the Sith. Holden, Jasper and Kiesse. Aeneas and Dido much? Jedis get no bitches. Practiced certamen with the intermediates. Grabbed dinner with Jasper. Kinda bummed that we got kicked out of History Club. Bad look. Catch up on assignments. Get out to run tonight. SLT tomorrow? Nearly 2 hours of Certamen today? Led Jasper back to Browning. Went to drop off a couple thing for Will Park at the Health Center. Easy run. Pulled 10 ups. Connect with Family. See how Chloe’s doing. Look forward to Ultimate Frisbee tomorrow. Pursue happiness. Think we’ll just ask Jacqueline to hang out tomorrow at the OMA meeting.</p>

Games of stone-face on the 213. <em>Broccoli Palace</em>. Arrived at the Chicago Botanic Garden. Visitor center. Seeds for Tiger Paw Aster and Shishito Peppers. Entered the greenery. Pendula Norway spruce draped brick terraces. A big fish in the pond. Bethlehem sage, and lamb ears! Wide fluffy mint. The faint smell of Virginia bluebells, lemony magnolias. Herbals on teas in the Regenstein. The tropical greenhouse of cacao and dendrobium orchids. The bloated roots of a desert rose and variegated devil’s backbone. Water features and wishing pennies.

Sweet sweet scent of a Japanese plum, <em>prunus mume.</em> Clouds. The Linnaeus sculpture, the <em>princeps botanicorum</em> plucking from a rosebush. Firefly lamps with butt-lights.

Malhar is building his paypal mafia. Compiling a list of talent on campus. Big fan of Peter Thiel, says his favourite book is Hofstader&#39;s GEB. Godel, Escher, Bach. We spoke about the knowledge economy. He told us to check out Tyler Cohen&#39;s marginal evolution.</p>

<p>YC Talk Notes:
Jared Friedman and Ankit Gupta. A purely people based heuristic for finding successful startups. A founder is a type of person, not a role. Ankit&#39;s advice for solopreneurs is to find a cofounder. Because all startups die by suicide—not homicide—and just having someone else makes it much harder for you to give up. In terms of cofounders, either look for someone you know extremely well, or find someone you have a history of building projects with. </p>

Somebody app was a public art project that invited strangers to become vessels for messages sent over the internet. Think sleeper agents activate to deliver a breakup text. </p>

Read Mishima&#39;s Golden Temple on our walk back home. Three plates of salad with ranch. Did our laundry. Clean slate.</p>

<p>Doctrine: Abortion kills, maybe certainly. But we kill too when we eat. On the whole, there is too little concern for life in modern living. The necessary lubricants of convenience—factory farms and sweatshops—demand death everywhere. Put simply, the non-vegan pro-lifer is a hypocrite; if they are proponents of life, there are greater and more immediate concerns. And for those who claim a speciality to <em>human life</em>, let it be said that our differentiation from animals is artificial. Tribalism cannot be an adequate moral framework in the 21st century.</p>

<p>Notes with Will Park:
Medici—Patronage—feudal relationships. Subversion can just be making the non-obvious obvious. Marx. Can we do something with de-objectification, pulling the human back out of objects? &quot;Realizing the human API.&quot; Think of the grooves that tell you a vase was made by a set of human hands. If not a tag, can it appear like a patch on a shirt, or an imprint in the material? Subtle but tactile, inseparable from the material just as human labor is. See Berlin&#39;s The Human Touch. Artisans tailoring shirts with fluorescent dyed hands so that the final product under UV light is so clearly a culmination of people. Think time, lineage, imprints, chrysalis. Maybe bacteria on a petri dish. The microbiome in your gut? All kinds of fingerprints. [[Substack]]</p>

The camera pans, and we see the back of “the whale” sitting on the beach.<br>Act 2: The whale goes through their routine completely invisible to the people around them. He is so nonexistent that even his room is occupied by other people who don’t notice his presence.<br>Act 3: The whale finds a walkie talkie and plays with it. It makes static which others can hear.

Would be nice for Chisholm to speak at the end of year dinner. A history of libraries. Collect soundbites. Slept on the third floor of the library. Freaked out a little. Got bit by grass. Went to architecture club. So the catcher in the rye loses. Played tag on the lawn. Guessed animals. Sesquipedalian. To your eternity. Extra life. Long weekend. Talk to Claire. Midnight in Lamont.

So bright and nice out. Henrik Karlsson&#39;s Escape Flatland. @junggarments is a princeton grad—crazy stuff. Slept. Ordered WHPK hats and merch. Masculine tendency to want to reorganize our life in bursts. Out on a run. Into the storm. Clock that wind! Drenched in seafoam. [[Papam]]. Military commands, frozen hands. Sheltered in Regent&#39;s market. Pope caught up with us. End of an era. Lamb, lion, viper, dagger. Corella talked us out of blazing glory, spending the rest of our life seaside in Rimini.

<p>Escape flatland. At least we write daily, even if our thoughts are more like fragments. The word is the corpus. Consolidate major themes into articles. Zinger economy, 200 word flash fiction. Do intentional harvesting from our reads.</p>
<p>—
We have this spectacular month to make college &quot;college.&quot; The stuff of our dreams. Realize the possibilities that we love so much about this place. Go by the point. What&#39;s stopping us? Feeling sick/allergic. Pressure of essays and stuff to do? We need a good teen movie. The mechanism behind procrastination is very simple, we do not care so we don&#39;t want to do it.</p>
<p>As long as its not our laziness or lack of outreach. Talk less to others about our metacognition around relationships and people. Just be there—be present. That&#39;s all we need to do. If it is bildung it is kosher. Maybe its important for us to live with other people, that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been missing out on for the past couple of years.</p>
<p>Our top experiences:</p>
<ol>
<li>skinnydipping in lake michigan at the dunes + taking that dump in the parking lot</li>
<li>sitting with our friends on adirondacks back at exeter upper spring</li>
<li>kissing gabby after trick or treating together first year</li>
<li>riding our skateboard last summer down the lakefront/skating back to north at night after signing off from ida as a building manager.</li>
<li>running with bango brothers along the presidio.</li>
<li>curling into bed with our grandma when we were still a kid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Commonalities? oceanic feeling, euphoria, sense of fulfillment?, comfort, safety, freedom, actualization. </p>
<p>Compelling projects: [[Amigo]]
Deobjectifcation, material tracing. made by human tag?
Object swapping, object sharing, How I met your mother&#39;s yellow umbrella. 
The chain, serendipity algorithm, see duet app. </p>
<p>Learn prompt engineering and vibe coding.
This can go very far.
Best career plan: lock ourselves in a room for a day and make something cool.

Tea menu, Neon Genesis Evangelion posters, collectibles floor to ceiling. Jo and Palmer hosted for 5 hours from 7 to 11. Stopped by CVS to pick up some chicharones near midnight.</p>
<p>Dreams of empire. Billions in racing bioengineered weapons. Colossal bioworks. All 23 horses descended from Secretariat.</p>
<p>A clean room is a well ordered mind is a well oiled machine. AI digital clones? What are the projects to start in that dimension? Reorder. [[Visualize]]</p>
<p>From the notes: 
&quot;How do we change who we are? We change what we do. How do we change what we do? We change what we think. How do we change what we think? We change what we consume.&quot;</p>
<p>We ought for sure to be sexually active. That is an important part of life. 
Reach back out to our friends from high school.
Dress better, keep clean, remember to listen.</p>
<p>Notes from Palmer and Jo&#39;s writing discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>narratives work based on author-reader contracts. genres construct a set of promises that the author must deliver on. e.g romance expects &quot;getting together&quot; to always be at the end. think about our confusion with how col49 ended, that was a question of pacing.</li>
<li>writing is fundamentally an exercise in empathy. understanding the reader and how they might react to do expectation management.</li>
<li>prose-narration is a unique skill. learning how to selectively focus on things in a scene and manufacturing bokeh is key to visual description. think intensely about pov, what&#39;s included and what&#39;s not, avoid overvisualization. these are genre basics.</li>

Finished Breakfast of Champions. Kilgore Trout, Job-figure. Quick lunch at Baker. Ran into Clancy on the quad. Wandered. Settled under the arch of the Rockefeller chapel doors. We’re all green, could lay down on the grass and camouflage. Take an ivy cutting. Dropped by Saieh. Ran into Michael Moran. Had a good convo with Olivia Rae. Inflammation of the brain. Talked to Austin about the Lumen Christi Fellows. Become an art critic, or at least an avid theater-goer, make use of Chicago opportunities. Aztec Human Sacrifice. 10,000 Maniacs.

Visited the health center under suspicion of Covid-19. If we do go in, do pushups and just take time to read. Have plenty to write between “the Eye” and Miranda v. Arizona. Came back all negative. Did our due diligence. Finished our Rushdie reading. Phantasms of the Sundarban. Walked to Walgreens with JF. The Colophon Bookstore. Stumbled onto a Banh Mi operation in the church basement. Idylls of the King. See if we visit the Colophon again with Holden this weekend. Ivan Bilibin. Koschei the Deathless. Took a nap in the heat. Set up the calligraphy stand at Asian carnival.

Bob Dylan. The Six. Raindrops on train tracks, reminiscent of fort rock. Didn’t know mints could flower. Took the metra up. Compose our cover letter. Windy by the beach. Called Vincent at Northwestern. Aztec Human Sacrifice! Ran into the director, Jay Espano. Sat on the wooden steps of the train tracks. Took the L, then the metra back. Walked backwards from 63rd. Productive day, writing wise. Transcribe our thoughts on Aztec Human Sacrifice. Got dinner at Tiffins, Tofu Stew. Applied to Oliver Wyman. Back to R2A? Journalism will save us. Fire alarm just as we were typing. Went out on the grass. Saw Sophia, Sumin lent us his jacket. Mom got our card for mother’s day. Called Jasper. The little islands in Hong Kong. Fire alarm again while we were calling Jasper.</p>

<p>Notes on Aztec Human Sacrifice:<br>Heartbeats. Love, death, and god all revolve around the physicality of the heart.<br>Relentlessly human story in meso-american fashion.<br>Lovers killed in the heat of passion, their faces forever imprinted with ecstasy.<br>Turandotic night, citizens brandishing torches.<br>This idea of preservation in death, perhaps humorously paradoxical, but genuine.<br>In the desert, the abstract becomes the physical.

<p>Coolcat: Had a great weekend. Asian carnival was a great time, and the weather’s now undeniably summer. Last Friday was long past, but please indulge me in talking a little about Ted. I was really happy to see many of you show up because that talk was really written with y’all in mind. I talked for 10 minutes, but if I was only given 10 words, I’d say this: moments escape us, but memories are for us to keep. </p>
<p>The slow dripping of these next three weeks into the abyss at the bottom of the sandglass is inevitable, but I’ll be holding on to it as best I can with you all. And though ultimately we will lose, let it be known that the struggle is in our favour. Those careful can see that there are as many grains of sand packed into that span of three weeks as there are stars in the night. So here’s to our little infinity, though there are no faults in our stars.</p>
<p>Doctrine: On the present. If we considered appreciation to be thought, given that we cannot think about the present as it occurs, it would be impossible to appreciate the present. Thus, we must define appreciation of the present in other ways, by experience and not cognition. Only then can we live a good life, balancing the present with recalling the past and experiencing the future.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Woke up and walked to poli-sci. Gone, gone, gone. Hebraisms. Elijah’s videography. Sausage and gravy. Went to exoplanets. Submitted our article and interview on <em>Aztec Human Sacrifice.</em> Ran into Tom in the reg, A level regulars. We’re credited on a paper! Generation of LexA enhancer-trap lines in <em>Drosophila</em> by Kockel et al. Lunch with Michael Moran. The game of nim. Sunsetz on the quad with Elijah and Ben. Published a coolcat. Slightly chilly. Grabbed wazwan at Hutch. Ate with Ruka and Robert. Rubbed spice into our eyes. Walked home. Reset. Went to Johanna D’Arc of Mongolia. Fever dream? On mutual exoticism, what is the role of a spectator? Films never digitized—experiments of ephemerality. Talked to Bi on our way out back to ihouse. </p>
<p>Coolcat: Sunset is timeframe, event, and impetus. </p>
<p>Doctrine: Have learned from our coolcats to oscillate between description and explanation, to keep a rhythm, a heartbeat. Think we should never dwell too long in either the physical or the cerebral. Thoughts need to be anchored by events, and events demand reflection. </p>
<p>What’s due<br>On willingness to take on arbitrary thought<br>On antipodes. Journey into the desert.<br>On the flesh and purity of soul.<br>On Asian American manifest destiny. </p>
<p>Notes on Johanna d’Arc of Mongolia:<br>Signs in the void, the artificiality of the <em>premiere fois</em> of cultural contact. Cultural exchange is fueled by exoticism of the unknown. Certainly, exchange can be beneficial, but it does not happen without coercion—the European travelers were forced out of the claustrophobic carriages into the open steppes via a hijacking. In the film, the choice of what’s subtitled and what’s not, whether it was intentional, delineated the foreign from the familiar. The travelers’ experience in the train is meant to be contrasted with their experience in the steppe. Food is the first point of contact—the princess offers the guests milk as her first sign of hospitality. Though contrast accompanies contact—the skinning and gutting of a goat reflects a sanctity not found among the Europians. The ending in which the Mongols board the trans mongolian railway and reveal themselves as modernized—only ”upholding the illusion of free nomadic life”—is curious but mutualistic “exotic attraction” is not convincing as a defense for exoticism when the Mongols need to adopt European dress. Nevertheless, the film frequently calls into question the role of a spectator, with the travelers taking photographs, recording in journals, and making pictures of the experience. To look at Johanna d’Arc of Mongolia as a movie would be inaccurate, it is perhaps closer to an ethnography that makes the audience aware of, and consequently question their role as a spectator—though it certainly is burdened by the cultural vestiges of its time. </p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Morning. Chloe texted us that Dad might have another kid. A sweater and a jacket. Crumpled up and sobbed a little. Sorted out Indo visa. Showered. Took out the steak in the fridge and cooked it up with Lola. Mirin glazed. Went down to Baker for more food. Dogs are feet not toes. Food trucks on the quad after lunch. Summer breeze 25. Bouncy castled with Celina and Rachel. Settled in Harper to type things out. William Blake&#39;s divinity. Dinner with Amber. Born Slippy—Trainspotting. Finished writing our Canto. Laundry, showered. Stopped by Zummfest. Ethan is going to send us Oaxaca recs. Left because we weren&#39;t feeling it. Made steak for Billy. Had an egg by ourselves. On Earth We&#39;re Briefly Gorgeous.</p>
<p>Ocean Vuong wrote something beautiful.</p>
<p>How hard is it to know thyself? Think that&#39;s a really good question. Don&#39;t think we know anyone who doesn&#39;t rely on one substance or another. And of course we do too. The years they run, we are nothing and everything again. Can we get rid of the noise?</p>
<p>Felt really sad towards the end of the night, thinking that we&#39;d only cultivated fair-weather friends. Do people come to us with their problems? Went down to Zumfest somewhat aimlessly between our laundry washing and drying. Riding back, a girl stopped us and asked if she could ride with us because her friend was having a panic attack. Wading in waist high water. Thought about Jacqueline a little. Looked in the mirror while brushing our teeth and realized for what its worth—we like the person we are. That wasn&#39;t always the case.</p>

Cried over Ocean Vuong and a cup of English breakfast. What&#39;s a good use of free will? Met with Joe, spoke about Schwarzman. Hopped in the jacuzzi at Colin&#39;s Colin Shorts. Juice with Alex Zou in the 4th floor study room. Look into MCP servers, a la Ashwin and Alex building Mint Cashback. Touched phones. 1 year 1 summer to make more. Vuong and Giancarlo Exposito both considered monkhood. 90 pushups after 2 am. </p>

The virus is a gamete. The &quot;organism&quot; is the infected cell.

<p>We will lose our things. We can lose our body. 
Even a photograph is just a reflection.
But a baby learns speech and speech becomes all he is—
We are fathers and sons, yeah, mothers and daughters, yeah. </p>
<p>What would Mishima say to Vuong? Do we lose sincerity in narration? Do words confine or create the experience? The unit of the novel is not the sentence but the paragraph. If we write from a tradition of poetry, we&#39;ll find our attention misplaced. What is the substance under the form? Is it christian revival, is it wandering, is it—</p>
<p>Politics define our language. Language is inherently political. David Foster Wallace, why does it work? The straight masculine perspective, in an ironic turn of events, may be the least examined.</p>
<p>Morphonyms. Change a word letter by letter till it no longer resembles it. Becomes another thought. Kierran spoke to us of faulty machines over breakfast. He and his 7 siblings. Breakfast of Champions. 80 years a washing machine, called herself our grandmother, who with wheels would be a bicycle. but we are more than the sum of our parts—</p>

Fermi’s Paradox. <em>We’re not special…</em> Ate at Baker. Walked home to do laundry. Finish Oedipus at Colonus. There Will Come Soft Rains by Ray Bradbury. Nectar by Joji.

To come to terms with the inevitable.<br>Oedipus is self prophetic about his death, and in death he is redeemed.<br>The cultural significance of lamentation. A decision to unclothe.

In the narrow confines of my now abode—room 203, the pangs of solitude strike again and again at my heart. Indeed, my body, my soul, my animus all seem to reverberate a deep tune of despair. My only relief—the unending kindness of the health center staff and a most pleasing visit this morning from the one and only J Money. Long story short: please come visit me at the health center. I would love to see you all. If you stand at a stone circle and call out my name three times, I will most certainly appear.</p>

Keep ourselves up to date on vaccines. Grabbed a muffin from the courtyard. Spring fountains. Mock trial theater. Dillinger’s footlong. Got dressed for Mock media day. Walked back to ihouse, talked to Emily in the courtyard. Took a long midday nap. Profound sadness. Four days till we leave. Four days till the end of this year. Start packing stuff into boxes tomorrow. Wrote to Sophia, Devin and Ryan on Mother’s day cards. Why are these last days of the year so cold? Had rice and pulled pork down at Tiffins. <em>Good things will come to you</em>, Lincoln. </p>
<p>Felt uneasy to be confronted, like things dug up needlessly. Let things pass.<br>Writing to prove one’s humanity. Beauty as the capacity for receiving divine providence, divine in the sense of extra-human. For we have loved people just because they were beautiful.<br>Rhyme is a generative device, words program words.</p>
<p>During our midday nap, dreamt that the interstellar jets had parked themselves outside our window. Their pilots in white and orange motorcycle suits. Then we climbed down the lift cord of our window blinds, which went all the way down outside. Woke up in fairyland. dreamt that we lived in a dorm composed of layers of bunks, entrances barricaded by red cushioned armchairs. We donated a wheelbarrow to the all-state magic tournament. Then dreamt that we had lived a past life where our coolcats ended at 19, and felt sad for the brevity of that past life.</p>

If we&#39;re still consuming smooth-brained slog we&#39;re dead.</p>
<p>Reform our substack to write good articles.
Skating makes us much more acquainted with surfaces. It&#39;s tactile. We know the streets that are smooth to ride on and those that are not. What do we call this sort of knowledge.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t mind the curse of the wandering jew.
Have to pull out stamps funding.
How odd that the only way to get better at something is very simple, to do it more.
For this reason, as Ada Palmer says, novelists tend to begin at 40.
Franz Kafka&#39;s Diaries.</p>
<p>From our rare moment of clearheadedness, a memo to self:</p>
<p>Personal productivity: some time ago we wrote about the importance of having rituals to pause and evaluate. Re-centering is the difference between losing a couple hours and losing a day (to sadness, to anger, to sloth). How do we create consistent interruptions to break us out of autopilot? Our most effective ones have been: run, shower, intentional eating (no devices). Death-reminders and the muslim practice of 5 daily prayers may be worthy additions. We have never been more in need of prayer. </p>
<p>Living with intention. Can&#39;t believe our for-credit business elective on ethics actually taught us something about living life better. Morality, eudaimonia, and good living comes from consistent recentering—crafting effective interruptions to remind ourselves of what goodness is. We can lose hours, we can lose days, we cannot lose months and years. That will be throwing our life away. @yur_mean should be the level of daily chronicling we aspire to.</p>
<p>The very best people, machine, companies—intelligences—operate off feedback loops. They define metrics, strive towards them, evaluate their progress, and recenter according to outcome. </p>
<p>—
Another thing that&#39;s at the top of our mind. The life advisory board. Our time is limited, and we only have so much to share with friends. Keeping friend&#39;s close, especially in the 1 or 2 years after grad, is mostly a question of geography. Remember what we talked about with Daniel Zhang when we visited him last at Yale. Friends of intention are friends we make convenient to see. We create the structures to be with the people we care about. Go see Jakarta, but we&#39;ve got to be in New York.</p>
<p>In 5 years, we want to still laugh raucously. Belly-out. Fill the air with the very essence of our being. Almost falling backwards, in recoil. We want that to be how we interact with the world, with others. </p>
<p>We are not so innocent about our self-conception and how we see others now. We are much more jaded, critical, judgemental than we used to be, but we recognize that. We can be more genuine in our interactions in recognition of the fact that we&#39;re not blanketly open. Not everyone deserves our time. The people around us are people worthy of our time, and our commitment to them is an expression of how much we value them.

<p>&quot;How do you feel about graduating next year&quot; Ticking time bomb. &quot;What are your postgrad plans?&quot;</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense to do anything that&#39;s not involved with AI. People are not talking about the profound job-loss and social restructuring about to happen in the next five years. 5 days ago, NYT guest op-ed, Aneesh Raman Linkedin, &quot;bottom rung of the career ladder breaking.&quot; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/opinion/linkedin-ai-entry-level-jobs.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/opinion/linkedin-ai-entry-level-jobs.html</a>. There is no such thing as an industry safe from AI (is there any industry unchanged by the internet?) One can&#39;t just &quot;do things right&quot; anymore. Most employees are not going to be cost effective for firms (c.f Kapital), and firms have no loyalty to employees because their loyalty are to shareholders. On the other hand, Sam Altman believes we&#39;re going to see the first solopreneur billion dollar company next year: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelashley/2025/02/17/the-future-is-solo-ai-is-creating-billion-dollar-one-person-companies/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelashley/2025/02/17/the-future-is-solo-ai-is-creating-billion-dollar-one-person-companies/</a>. </p>
<p>As much as we love media, story creation, media is not a viable industry anymore. Google Veo 3 release yesterday means that the already saturated media-market is going to be absolutely flooded. We have to build something that directly participates in the AI pipeline. This could be data processing, infrastructure, or interface. The soil, the trunk, or the leaves. </p>
<p>The smartest decision we&#39;ve made has been to deviate from traditional careers as much as possible and gain unorthodox experiences. We stand by it. &quot;Why no plan B?&quot; Plan B is not worth thinking about. Though our play is conditional on building something  people want.</p>
<p>Paper from Alex Zou. Three traits definitional to success: intelligence (we have some of this), conscientiousness (we excel in this), emotional stability (we absolutely suck at this). If we fix our emotional stability—fix the three body problem—we can be consistent enough to build something great and to keep working on it.

<p>I once read from an article that the people of Bhutan are the happiest people in the world, because they think about death five times a day. The idea is that because the Bhutanese think about death so often, they never forget to live. The article advertised an app that I ended up downloading. 5 times a day I would receive a notification reminding me that I was going to die, and I&#39;d open up the app to a quote from c.s lewis or someone else. Over time, it became pretty hard for me to believe that I was actually going to die, but I cannot understate the number of times it drove me to make good choices.</p>
<p>I remember explaining this app to my friend Claudia over dinner. It&#39;s such a silly idea but it works. It made me more patient with my mom. It made me realize that pulling up to the function is important, because your friends do miss you in your absence.

<p>I feel like I&#39;m ending my third year of college in a pretty weird place. I looked around the other day and realized that I&#39;m doing none of the things that I started college off with. One of the hardest things for me to come to terms with is that I&#39;m not going to be an RA next year, which really messes with my head. Will I really be going home at the end of the day, if I don&#39;t end up running into Lola and Thomas on 9 and end up playing protobowl until 1?</p>
<p>The other effect of leaving people and roles behind is that it&#39;s blown apart theories I&#39;ve had about about who I am. If I am not what I do, or the people I&#39;m with, who I am? I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ve come to a good answer to the question, but at least I&#39;ve started to think about it. At the end of the day, it&#39;s possible that the question might not matter. Do I really need to embody an idea, or just a kind of openness?</p>
<p>—
I&#39;m seeing all these EOY reflections on here from Kiesse and Angela and Eamin and I really appreciate them, often because of how much I empathize. It&#39;s reassuring to me that I still think similarly to these people I admire so much, and that I still think just as deeply as I did when I started college.</p>
<p>I really like writing because it gives me pause and the opportunity to be more of myself. As I look back at these last couple of years, I think I&#39;ve done a pretty good job. I am everything I liked a</p>

<p>Coolcat: One man’s advice for finding home was carrying an oar to a people who know nothing of the sea. A year ago, leaving home, I did not know what Chicago would bring. I thought my journey to the west was an exile, envisioned that I would be “marooned in the cold dark heart of America.” That could not be further from the truth. At a mock trial tournament this winter, I left a grey sweatshirt in an Iowan McDonalds—this was the farthest I had been inland. I like to think I left my sweatshirt there on purpose. A tribute. My friends, thank you, thank you, thank you, for your kindness, patience, and care. Three quarters in this beautiful city surrounded by beautiful people, here’s to three more!

Got our grades back in the car. 4.0 school year, academic weapon we are. Why no monkeys in North America? Arrived in long Island, home of the Great Gatsby. Feasted on ribs.

He’s digging and it’s not fast enough, but at least he’s looking up. Catch Nick tomorrow. Came back at 11 to the Browning boys around a campfire. Dorm auction, stories of Spanier and Alex Norton. Joe Hunt. The PGs were high watching Black Mirror. Belew, a master storyteller. Morgan (Johnson) and Morgan (Lee). Went up to the roof with the boys. Raining now, and the streetlights are empty.

Duncan ran with the boys at 4. Ran into Zara, Cam, Johnny, Rodrigo, Rosen, Harry and Gianluca. Bought a Boston Creme and a Mango Pineapple Drink™. Talked to Vigneri on the way back to the dorm and caught up on sleep. Woke up three hours later and went to Ms. Josef&#39;s place. Had eggs with the old seniors before Closing Assembly. Myers spoke about room b4a (what comes before A?), and PRaw spoke about Lou Gehrig. Sweet Caroline gave a fitting end. Walked with Jacqueline, Maya, Lara and Indigo to Me and Ollies. Ran into Joy from 2020. Played spikeball with Vincent and LeCong. Carried boxes to Bancroft before returning to more spikeball with Claire and her friends. Said goodbye to Aidan in Grill, who made us tear up. Helped Ethan move his things into Bhaus. Deposited some dorm relics: our Nixon snowglobe and the Celebration of Vulcan. Kept our Memento Mori snow globe. Ran down to the bookstore and got 50 dollars for our books. Saw Sabrina again. Made our last grill purchase on the way back: two noodles and three eggs. Saw Jason from 2020. Met Indigo’s father by the music building. Rested, then picked up our OMA stole and a dinner gift card from Praw. Read Charlie’s med: <em>Comites Kirtlandii.</em> Nick came by BHaus to say his goodbyes from JSmith. Came back and made noodles. Watched Stranger Things and took a fat nap. Woke up dizzy. Went down to Szech, where we ate family style with Clark, Maya, Jacqueline and Lydia. Crispy Beef. Walked back to campus through a passageway of shrubbery. Lavender dyed the sky a purple. Ended up watching Howl’s Moving Castle in Jacqueline’s room. Felt very silly in a very good way. Came back to Ryan, Paco, and Ben still in the dorm. Showered, vacuumed, and did laundry. Listened to Beige by Yoke Lore. Jacqueline’s prints.</p>
<p>Thoughts from our overnight talk with Will:<br>You can’t be in exile unless you wish to return home. The exile to Chicago. The loneliness of dying together.

The existence of another Lexi&#39;s created an alternate reality. Found our escape room at 4:20. Westower’s Study, the Eye of Horus. Jacqueline&#39;s best dance moves won us a five minute extension.

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>East rail line, lo wu crossing. A river&#39;s width, two destiny&#39;s. Crossed the border to Shenzhen. Lounged in the airport. Carapace ceilings. Flight back to shanghai. Figured out our VPN through UChicago connect. Cisco any systems. Dad came to pick us up. Feeling like we need a lot of work. The airbnb is two blocks from where we used to live. Familiar streets.</p>
<p>When we&#39;re bad at something, what we really mean is we&#39;re not used to it; just like the first time we went climbing at first ascent with Matt and Jarcher and felt our fingers bare. At some point it must become possible. The only way to get better at anything is practice.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Met Clark at Brunch. JaQ and Janalie came back and joined us. Made our last visit to the Newsroom. Went back and packed a little. Taraz helped interpret our Muslim box—first chapter of the Quran. Mom and Chloe coming at two. Plan out clothes for the next couple days. The NJCL Convention. Salvete, sodales. Make summer plans when we get to it. Taking in the moment but feeling fairly tired now. Call Jacqueline over the summer. Senior reception at three? Make sure to run over the summer. Sunset at 8:00. Packed things up, we should be ready to move. Packed some things for Charlie’s. Mom came by at 2:00. Saw Chloe. Moved things into the car. Iron our shirt before tomorrow. Went to the Senior reception. Knapp gave us some kind words. The spiral highways of Hong Kong. Showed Chloe and mom around campus and the Lamont gallery. Met Gretl’s father. Went to Cap Thai. Introduced Chloe to Jacqueline. Had green curry. Adventuresome degree spice. Banc at 8:00. Consulted Quora. Gazed at the trees. Take Yours. took deep breaths. Jacqueline’s nervousness manifested anyway. All good though, we could spend two hours staring at a wall with her. Ended up in a game of We’re Not Really Strangers. Talked about our fathers, and her love of freedom. Made a wildcard count. Melted and spent the next half hour pressing our cheek onto her forehead, as if we could merge into one blob. She told us she felt free. Made some promise of a trip to Stillwells. Ran back home. Spoke to Daniel about Chisholm and gratitude. Cheeseballs. Time and Geography. The preps are tight, good to see that Bhaus did not die with us. The future is insured. Going to Gale park tomorrow at 6. Fold a paper crane. Invited to the function. Harry’s house at three. Shower. Get ready for tomorrow. This is it. Sleep well. Last night in our bed. Do laundry in the morning. 40 minutes.</p>
<p>On the fourth floor of Bancroft, at the end of the hall under a lofted bed, dressed in white, our Keith Haring t-shirt, black belt buckled round canvas shorts, looked out at a blue sweater. Her eyes and nervous smile asked us why we were looking at her so intensely. We made a wildcard count. The red card in our hand, the amber of the moment, there is no why. </p>
<p>She did ask us why we had to leave.</p>

Thinking about republishing the March 30 note. Charlie is Socrates in Phaedo. JaQ gave us advice about crashing. Mom and Chloe picked us up. Zoom Charlie over the summer. Visited Brown. Ran into Maya. Incan artifacts at the John Hay library. Took a picture with Caesar Augustus. Back in Hamden. Felt sad again unpacking our things. Rest up and get going. Began a new log. Cried our eyes out in the shower. Reaching a deeper understanding of Catullus 5 and 7. A falling star. Time is a gravity. Memory is a dream. Makes sense for the classics diploma to be in Latin. Kind of ridiculous how much we’re crying. Don’t want to be a washed up senior. Plugged in our alarm. Waking up tomorrow at 6. 106 days. Look into French. Mikey bean is our only reassurance. Mr. Langford followed back. Taking a break tonight. Call someone everyday. Jason Huang reached out. Wisdom knots and the secrets of the Dja. Felt angry leaving Exeter. Crashing’s a pretty chaotic show, on a recommendation from Jacqueline. Absorb literature—do what JaQ said. Keep listening to music. Think we found Prentiss Cumming’s copy of the Odyssey, namesake of the Book fund. Paris time is 6 hours ahead. Finis origine pendet. Will be on our own between Jun 12 and 30. Practice living. Started ludus. Watched Stranger things.</p>
<p>Jac, watching you sleeping so peacefully on the long couch in the library basement, I could be there forever. If it was up to me, we would have danced all night in the moonlight, and when dawn came, asked her for another hour, then another, then another. But the day must break, and so you leave me cursing the rising sun. </p>
<p>“Would you kiss me?” That little shrug, you sitting cross-legged. “I guess I would,” you said sarcastically and moved closer. Trying to remember now the feeling of your lips.</p>

Ran the Norwegian Wood route from Komagome to Yotsuya. Past Iidabashi, ran by the river to Yotsuya station. Visited Suga Shrine in the rain. A particular set of stairs. Took the Yamanote line back home. Cool 7 miler, always save the day. Had a goated French toast from 7/11. </p>

<p>Coolcat: Been meaning to draft some sort of a note here since I said goodbye to the majority of you last Thursday. For good reason, that’s been tough, and only more difficult after grad. In an earlier version of this note, I would have said that “only brevity can approximate infinity” and left something short and sweet here, but I’ve realized that I’m too young and stubborn to go gently into the night. I have a good number of things to say to you all, and I’m planning to spread them out over separate posts over this week and the next. So please forgive me for the black squares about to invade your feed. Friends, if you’ll bear with me:</p>

Lychee and Mangosteen. Homegoing travelogues. Took a poll of who’s in Hong Kong this summer. Connecticut and the tristate area resembling the planet Arrakis. Dropped mom off at 元朗. Had dinner at 大家樂. What’s happening in New York? Thunderstorms for the next week. Did push ups until our arms were sore. Eat well, eggs and protein.</p>

<p>Listen to music. Might be our only defense.<br>The power of anecdotes, stories are our common currency.</p>
<p>Snippet: When we got to the airport my grandmother picked us up. Her hair sported patches of white. She was visibly older. She told me she had stopped dyeing it. “There’s no use,” she said.</p>

Luke came over for lunch. Made steak. Convo until 3. Talked memory, politics, and gorillas. Walked over to the point for a swim with Ann. Scientists Successfully Teach Gorilla It Will Die (The Onion)</p>
<p>Notes on a conversation with Luke: Talked about how fickle our collective memory is. The “state of nature” is a retroactive reconstruction. The study of anthropology has always been plagued by contemporary narratives of who we are (via Apes and Human Evolution). Value of a statistical life. WTP (Willingness 2 Pay) for an additional one percent chance of dying. </p>
<p>Here is what I’m thinking: This is our base of operations. 104 days till the end of summer. Of course we count. We are the hand of the arm that reaches towards the sky, the tip of the conscious universe.</p>
<p>Amigo: what we’re really tackling is drinking culture. People are tired and want more meaningful and fulfilling social interactions. They don’t want to get wasted anymore. </p>
<p>Stranger #3: Met Jesus and his brother Juan “Tookie” at the point, who tried to hit on Ann. Got Jesus to take a dip in the water with us. Fabuloso. Jesus was from Sinaloa. For unclear reasons, his brother Juan Tookie initially told us he was Jesus’ cousin.</p>

<p>Coolcat: “Been feeling extremely silly this past week. Just wanted to push something out because I feel tremendously connected to you all here, and my juices have sort of run dry trying to deliver any sort of comprehensive reflection on the infinity (@wlmpark) that is Exeter. I’ve mulled over what I have wanted to say for the past couple days now, and I’ve realized that everything goes back to a single phrase—thank you; thank you to every one of you for the beautiful moments we shared and for the genuine conversations we had. It’s pretty hard to describe fully the extent that your collective words and actions have had on me, but just looking through the countless instances recorded in my journal, I am undoubtedly a product of you all. It is you guys that have solidified in me the belief that Exeter is not a place, but a people. This realization has been reassuring for me—knowing that Exeter continues to be a present through y’all means that it won’t become a past for me to dwell in. I often look to the past for my future, and I think now I’ll make reference to a post I archived here on March 30th. It’s a post that I don’t think most of you have seen because I hid it when most of you came aboard. Now that I’ve released it back to the murky depths of this account, it resembles a thermocline between a past where I was lost and a present where I am no longer. It’s the mark I look at to say “we’ve grown a lot since then.” Bringing this up because also in that post, I wrote that I was “looking forward to growing up together with you all.” I’d like to make the same declaration again, realizing fully the difficulty that the word “together” brings given the reality that I may not see some of you ever again in person. I guess I challenge the forces of time and geography. Let’s zoom, let’s call, let’s text. If star-crossed lovers be, then why not star-crossed friends?”</p>

<p>Stranger #4: Jacob was drawing in a sketchbook when we approached him. He had just moved to Hyde Park a couple weeks ago from El Paso. He’s an archeologist for the private sector, which, in loose terms, means due diligence for defense contractors and oil companies looking to excavate new sites. His work has taken him all over. We showed him our urbex expedition to the Damen silos, and he showed us some abandoned mineshafts in New Mexico. He also showed us pictures of what appeared to be a 13th century Navajo settlement, with corn still left in the granaries. It looked exactly like that exhibit we saw in the field museum.</p>

Dinner out with Aboo, Mom, Chloe. 中山公园，龙之梦。Finally published the slow death. Listen to James Evans Big Brain podcast. Maybe we ought to write to James Evans. Capture as many of our thoughts into article form as we can. Chatted with Johanna. Emily Shi gave us some advice.

Finished our second drawing. Drink water. Table MTG until we get to Chicago in the fall. We need other people to be alive. Strophe. Weird ist fate. Thebes, o city of tragedy. Dog days are over, Florence and the Machine. Thrall to enthrall, to make slave. Βοωτης, the herdsmen. Woah woah woah, a tad violent Oedipus. Back to Cithaeron. Loxias, Phoebus, Apollo. Finished Oedipus. Lord of Extinction. Call Indigo at 5. Move to the picture of Dorian Gray. Then Phaedo. Make dinner with the Rotisserie chicken. Ip Man 6. The intersection of dragonflies and Coraline. Watched Jasper play chess on discord. They’re scared. They’re scared. Went out. Found a track at Hamden High. Do some mile trials maybe. Clone ourselves in a self-portrait. Candids. Meeting Clark tomorrow at seven. Watch out for college programming on the 15th. Cryptic turtle. Expanded Coolca. Koalemos. Phil Horrigan’s gonna be in Chicago. Called Kirtland on Discord. Played a bit of Minecraft. Spear and shield.</p>
<p>“Sirrah, what mak’st thou here?”<br>“I love minecraft but just don’t want to live in a fake world”</p>
<p>Woah woah, two posts in a week? Slow down, buddyroo. But yes, it&#39;s Cool Cat here with another black square. Been doing okay lately, think we’re going to use this space to document our summer now. Spending much of the last forty eight hours with ourselves has only confirmed the fact that we need other people to be alive. Two recent developments: 1) found a track on our run tonight—will probably do some time trials there in the future and 2) driving has actually been really hard but we’re learning. Highlight of the day was watching Jasper play chess on the Kirtland discord. Please drop some suggestions for fun solitary activities in the comments.</p>
<p>Coolcat: Woah woah, two posts in two days??? Slow down. But yes, I am back again sort of with a plea for help. I am doing quite well now but I mean what I said with my last post. I am finding myself living alone for a bit and so I would appreciate the voice of other human beings. Also hoping to use this place now to document my summer. Please drop in the comments suggestions for fun solitary (or non-solitary activities)</p>

Found an efficient rhythm to stocking rooms. We’re going to the RNC! Dinner at 6:00. Nap and clean up our room between now and then. They Might Be Giants with Moran on Tuesday? Read <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>. Had dinner at Luke’s. Almost didn’t but went 4 miles with Juliana. </p>

Quick walk through the national museum. Grand Indonesia mall was kind of nice. Ate at a restaurant called Remboelan. Soupy rice. Started raining a bit around sunset. Got back home. Dinner at Grandma Pho again. Kind of bombed our mock interview. Last full day in Jakarta. Mom and Chloe flying back home tomorrow.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Day 94<br>The colours. Do Laundry. Sweet decadence. Oscar Wilde, The Sphinx. Put our clothes in the washer. Respond to Parv. Cooked our rice for the day. Refrain from “yeah no.” Recovered the browning facebook group. Had a good exchange with Parv. Rice, seaweed and eggs. Have got to shave. Make a grocery trip. Watched <em>Her,</em> like this movie already. Golden brown fried rice. Mix with egg yolk first. Scrumptious. 3 dimensional scrolling. Is <em>Her</em> an incel film? Prosciutto and brie. Camembert. Costco tiramisu has alcohol in it. Shanghai. Art hides the artist. Grab our laundry from downstairs. Take out the trash. Alexander the Great and the Opis mutiny. Purple cloak and diadem. Smooth run out in the rain. Took out the trash. Umbrella Academy season 3 coming Wednesday. Unabomber ayo? Industrial society and its future. The Caduceus and the rod of Asclepius. Felt silly about Jacqueline.</p>
<p>Taxi driver<br>Saving Private Ryan</p>
<p>Stole this format from Kevin. Here’s my tribute.</p>
<p>1. Classic black square.<br>2-3 Two dishes constructed in past days. Variations on rice, meat, and eggs. Burned our rice on our first try, so we added oil on the second and lowered the heat on our second try. All trial and error here.<br>4. Picture taken on a run looking down a hill. Track has been really nice. We need to move to be alive. Mighty slow still though, so looking to up mileage. 2-3 miles are not going to cut in anymore. Not pictured—went on a run with Clark.<br>5. Her. Just a beautiful film. The writing, the score, and the colours. Dressed in rose—in love. Dressed in yellow—danger/negative experience. Dressed in white—uncertainty/relationship evolving. Also the scenes with Shanghai. The lines laid in words and colour. Horribly pertinent. And of course LaMDA. Highly recommend it.<br>6 Been following your suggestions from the last post. Had some brie. </p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Day 82<br>Mom’s out of quarantine. Grabbed dim sum with the family. Took the bus down to Tsim Sha Tsui. Olger lost his phone last night at LKF. Called the police at Chungking Mansion. Indian food, some sort of Tatooine. Rode in a cop car. Bonded with Ashley as we were waiting for Olger at the Tsim Sha Tsui police station. Grabbed dinner with Angela. Felt some sort of closure to confess about Jacqueline and how much that meant to us. Walked around in the dark. Caught us in some sad boi hours. The arc of this summer, some sort of familial redemption. About escaping infantilization, the recognition from our parents of who we are as an individual. Someone playing Stand By Me on the train again. This is water, this is water, we will live. Wong Kar Wai, this city. </p>

Drove us down to Gambir Stasiun. 7 hour train ride. Finished the bag of food mom left us. Read through a couple hundred pages of Steve Job&#39;s biography. Outside, rice paddies, terraced. Mosques, white and gold minarets. Lotus pond. Passed mountains. Overwhelmingly green. A million little birds fly out. Mount Merapi in slight haze. Arrived in Jogja by sunset. There&#39;s a metro here? Free palestine graffiti. City seems walkable. Settled in our hotel. Did pushups. Cleaned up our face and put on a shirt. Walked around the neighborhood. Universities. Wisma Bahasa about half a mile north. Ate twice. Indo food, then Uncle restaurant, ran by a young Jay, speaker playing Friday Chinatown-esque Japanese 80s disco. Really good vibes.</p>

<p>“Hello there. My name is Toby. I am a recent high school graduate who is heading to the University of Chicago in the fall, now looking to help rising seniors find their voice in college application essays. You are making a great investment towards your future just by being here, and here’s why you might want to invest in me: <strong>Why me?</strong> I have a unique understanding of the situation you are in—I was in it just months ago. Like many of you, I didn&#39;t have a perfect GPA nor stellar extracurriculars, so I have to believe that my essays helped me stand out. I am painstakingly familiar with the common app, the UC application, and the Coalition application, and I want to be a pair of fresh eyes for you across any or all of these platforms. <strong>What can I do for you?</strong> You can expect constructive comments and actionable items that will not only polish the language of your piece (grammar, spelling, syntax) but help communicate your story in a clear and effective manner. <strong>Reach out and discuss before you pay for any option.</strong> I don’t have the same experience with Fiverr as I have with editing essays. I&#39;m flexible, so reach out. We’ll figure out something together that will help you fit your goals.”</p>

Stop wearing overly long shirts.

Good work with our body, but still mind and soul to save. Keep the music playing and the water cycle going. Anki time. Use to do lists again. Talked to Ming. Kept the water cycle going. r/relationship_advice. The reg. Crashing’s quite a good show. Read some of the narratives we wrote in Lazure’s class again. What sparse dialogue can do. Search: Narrative 1, Raining, Mummies, Change. We should try writing again. Have to lean into our own style. Brush strokes. Deadend Paranormal Park. Went driving again at 4.30. Light rain. Hopped on a run on our way back. Ran by Hamden High’s graduation. Went down Hartford direction till we touched one of those bridges. Having fish tonight. Umbrella Academy. Feeling very comfee. Dioramas. Creative Beast Studio. Stardust diorama. Looked through AGON. Marathon’s 24 miles. Easy money. Train. Only one thing to learn this summer, and that’s greek. The White Buffalo in Reginald’s Painting (Umbrella Academy).</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Day 78<br>Public holiday, no work. Moved out of Tai Po back to To Kwa Wan. Got Dim Sum with the family. Talked to Aboo as we were waiting for the bus. This is water, this is water, we can breathe. The titanic submarine incident. The survival film genre. Got back home. Took a massive midday nap. Resolved our network issues. Offered essay help. Watched The Boys. </p>
<p>Ubasute, the way up the mountain. Recalling Aeneas and his father, the sculpture inside the Latin study. To abandon with piety? A natural progression of life, the Ballad of Narayama. </p>
<p>Snippet: Had dinner with Angela a couple days ago. Last coolcat was a weak one. What is this guy talking about? Condensation of realities that suffocate. This is water, this is water. Proof of humanity. So much of why we write is to prove that we deserve to live. Recalling a scene in Avatar: Way of the Water. The scientist’s monologue as the drill goes through a Tulkun skull. Some terrific irony to the idea of killing something vastly more intelligent, emotional, and <em>human</em>. As if our humanity is defined by the ability to engage in depth of thought and feeling.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Laundry sorted. Ayam geprek from olive fried chicken was the wrong move. Sambal so spicy it burned. Bought ourselves a magnum to cool off. Made friends with the guys at burjo andeska—downstairs cafe/canteen. Ali and Erik. Teman teman. They asked us if we had seen the news in Iran (tidak bagus). Sat at one of the long wooden tables and worked. Riki texted while we were eating. Ended up taking a gojek ride to Mediterranea, french restaurant on Jalan Bule. Founder of Gojek/education minister/Brown alumn apparently tried to implement open curriculum for Indonesian schoolchildren. Walked about. People here think we&#39;re from Jepang, and that Riki looks like Malia Obama. Alhamdilillah anek amerika. Had chocolates, matcha and jahe, at Monggo, belgian chocolatier jogja. Followed Riki to artjog. Met Warisha, luce scholar. Cool exhibits, contemporary, out there. Reza Reshalan thirst trap, 5 minute no warning. Clothwork resembling plumbus&#39;s. A phone booth exhibit with a conversation across time, Kami No Nawa. Jogja an artist city, full of lennon-glassed, long grey hair, flowy shirted creative director types. Met Adarsh, fulbright scholar, via Warisha. Younger brother Nikhil is going to UChicago next year. Met Stefan, visiting professor of sociology, French—and Tim, another fullbright scholar. Adarsh and Stefan, over dinner, talked islamic syncretism. Stefan began his career in the middle east and can read arabic. 7 saints who brought islam to Java. 7 shrines north of the island. Wayang marathons, puppet show till 5 in the morning. Bahasa jaua. When they catch people falling asleep, they break from the Ramayana into politics. &quot;Corrupsi.&quot; Penis and scrotum quote the Koran. Pilgrims do it 7 times over the saint&#39;s grave. Part of the kraton has portraits of princes crossdressed as wayangs, dating back to the 19th century. Religious groups, the NU, and the Muhammidiyah, traditionalist and orthodox, can both be considered conservative based on framing. Riki then introduced us to some locals—May, Tofa, Altaf. Altaf&#39;s a Sufjan Stevens fan. Showed him sea swallow me (cocteau twins). All jiwa muda (young souls). Hard to tell ages here. Hitched a ride on Altaf&#39;s bike to a bar on Jalan bule. Kombucha. Listened to the band play the cranberries, they were good. Called a gocar back and fell asleep. Hari hari panjang panjang. Mindblowing day, especially as we were listening to Adarsh and Stefan riff off, and it was as if all the mysticism of the east was here. </p>

Intergenerationality. Caught up with Clark about college, thoughts on the pervasiveness of alcohol. Swam out to a platform with Angie and Ina. Rushed to Nam Cheong, our shorts wet, via Ocean Park. Met a couple people from LSE. Olger vs 婆婆 in badminton. Worked with the homeless to get them haircuts. Helped a man onto his wheelchair. Took the Tun Muen line back home. </p>
<p>Snippet: Ina asked us what our takeaway was from Exeter. So we told her about last summer. At Charlie Preston’s house with JaQ Lai realized in us the idea of a sort of intergenerationality that persists past grad. Intergenerationality that continues in the relationships we have with alumni and people still at the school. Relationships formed by kids parenting kids. Something we valued greatly—and perhaps unique about Exeter. Though Chicago has taught us much and transfojjrmed us in ways we could not have imagined. </p>

Mind, body, and soul. Remember why we started. Graphic novels. Reach out soon about the job offer. Went out for a night run. Felt good. Captain America. Haloes. Prepare food now. Keep the water cycle running. Use coolcat to create opportunities for social interaction. How do you like your eggs? A facsimile for conversation. Clean up/ take out trash tomorrow. Cereal for dinner, not gonna eat too much. Save food for tomorrow. Finish Wilde. Write a to-do list at the start of the day tomorrow. Coffee cheese and John Oliver. Accidental combos. Daybreak, what a great show. A Star is Born. Pick up a guitar. Will to live. Onan. </p>

<p>Cool cat<br>Fell off the face of the Earth for a bit here, but summer’s been really good. It was nice seeing Clark and Lara in New Haven last Sunday, and some of your suggestions from a while ago have kept us going. Been spending our time cooking, attempting handstands but also watching movies. Saw Her, Happy Gilmore, The Imitation Game, Spiderhead, Argo, Taxi Driver and Morbius (Yep). Morbius was terrible, but on the opposite side of the spectrum, Her was a really beautiful film. Had doubts going in with the premise—a lonely writer’s developing relationship with an artificial intelligence (think less black-mirror and more siri), but the film really managed to deliver something deeply human and strangely pertinent. News about LaMDA gaining sentience a few weeks ago coincided with our viewing of Her, and that may have been part of it. Really, I highly recommend you all to watch it. Hope you guys are doing ok, too.</p>

Richard goes to UofT, studies pharmaceudical chemistry, interning at Sanofi next fall. Told us all the money&#39;s in biopharma. Took a gojek to Adarsh&#39;s. Read Mishima en route. Sudirman Park. Showered. Adarsh gave us his copy of bandit saints of java. Read some 50 pages of it. Fascinating stuff. Recs for places to go: three S&#39;s to hike around Jogja. </p>

Lounged about in the water, the sand soft. Had skewers for lunch before Abigail showed us the rocks. Dawn in the Adan. Clear water in crevices. Crabs and sea urchins. People with their gloves and tongs wading through the water, collecting various mollusks. Got really close to a butterfly. Its veins leaflike. Arrived in Kennedy town at 4. Walked to the UChicago campus, round the mountain green. The islands in the distance. Black sesame soy milk. Returned to the mtr station with our phone dead. Ran into Phoebe from our TAPs class, we were shook. Sunburnt. Olger came, then 崔姐. Ate. Balled with the HKU masters students in the courts by the sea. 奥黑卡卡吃先生. Went to Shark’s place to play cards. Took a cab back home. </p>
<p>Snippet: On a rabid hunt for the black moth. An urge to capture living things. To take pictures of people’s shiba inus. To find a corner untouched. To section off a piece of land and say <em>I’m the king of this hill.</em></p>
<p>An affinity for those who get off at the same stop. Your neighbors. Our work has exposed us to every strata of society. Filipino, South Asian diaspora, refugees, expats. The cocktail bun is a metaphor. Who does Hong Kong belong to?</p>

Food stalls covered the entrance. Banyak orang. Paratroopers (?), and people grappling down from the roof of the monument. Had a soto ayam for breakfast, and bought two rice rolls before hopping on the Manahan. Read Mishima, read half of it. Shaved, showered, cleaned up at the Omah Garuda. Called Aboo, Mom. Book hotel for tmr and flight. Pack in the morning. Lowkey so tired for no reason. Listened to Illnoise. Went out for dinner. Picked up these Banoffee Wafers which were pretty good. Finished squid game. Started not feeling so good, stomach-wise.</p>

Had hot pot with Angie, Minseo and Jolie. Took the mtr back home. Not a lot of time to R2A. Slept. Revisited past entries. Pick up our documents tomorrow and realign ourselves with our goals. Check out Nhan’s work for a model of what we can do for the rest of this summer. </p>
<p>Think we prefer Repulse Bay to Shek O’s beach. The steep drop into water is nice, and the platforms are fun to swim to. The past couple of weeks living in Hong Kong. Participating in the rhythm of the city. MTR. Work has been goofy. Make sketches of places. </p>

<p>Tuesday we met a woman who had come to Jawa to soul search. Said she&#39;s getting to know some healers in the mountains, had just come off a stint training with shamans in Peru. We were repulsed because she committed the worse kind of crime—incoherence. This is what we risk becoming.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Day 77<br>The ape, the hunter, and the wiseman. Capite velato. Had a dream about what Chicago means. Build ourselves up. Cruising through the LoRs today. Go brush our teeth and make breakfast. Take editing as Rec letter practice. Use cutting boards for clay. Got bereal again. Felt good. If music be the food of love. “Your days have been your sonnets.” Finished Wilde. Working with some real pathos pieces. Done with our EPVN work before noon? That’s crazy. Green leaf college consulting, maybe we’ll actually do this. Reach out to Max. Talk to Sam Chang about frutor, and Smaiyl about his business. Set up a base of operations, and let people on the scheme at UChicago. Easy bucks. Green leaf masterscript. Business as organization. Put some weight into this, definitely doable. Master of Puppets. Levitating rocks. Your leaf laden walls. The moss grows green. Messed around on LinkedIn. Updated our info. Went on a six miler on the track. Light rain. Went slow. Did some cross-legged pull-ups, then flipped a big wheel around. Felt in control. Responded to Parv’s email. Smaiyl and Sam wrote back. Hope we get to go on Career Exploration Week in a week. Updated our resume. Big career advancement day. 20 days until convention, not a lot of time. Get some eggs. Liminality. Terrified, disjointed, screaming. Found the Mongol 800 song.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Day 65<br>Arrived in Bangkok. The car park bathed in purple light outside the Suvarnabhumi airport. Took a taxi to Ratchathewi. Our bunk at the Timber hostel. Making the vlog a real thing. Showered and slept. Our Planet II on Netflix, thought Gabby would be a fan of animal documentaries. Took the BTS to MBK for breakfast. Met Father John. Drove to a Chicken restaurant for lunch. Spicy ground duck. Sticky rice in bamboo weaved cups. Picked up food supplies at a Lotus. Loaded them up for our visit to the Camillian Center for Children living with disabilities. Toured the center. Goalie’d for a kid. Chickens. Iron Man Jesus on a mural. Took the BTS back to the city. Ran into Sami at Patpong. Had dinner at Iconsiam. The basement, a night market, complete with lanterns and an artificial river. Had crocodile on a skewer. 蚵仔煎. Tom Yum Oyster Vermicelli. Filmed a mukbang. Returned to our hostel. Visited a dispensary with Ashley and Olger. Watched them smoke. Stayed up with them and talked. Downed some eggs from 7/11. Discussed critical race theory. </p>
<p>At the Camillian center, after we took our photo, a kid held our arm and did the most muscular pose. We pretended to do a couple pushups. Understood him despite our barrier of language, a real tobyvfitness win. </p>
<p>Asian American identity formed via immigrant experience, an inherent loneliness. The biracial-esque racial “medium” experienced by Asian Americans perhaps a tautology for America’s inability to register Asian Americans in its rigid racial binary.</p>

<p>Song: Caroline by Animal Years. 29 by Run River North. Summer Clothes by Marc Scibilia.  Mountain Song by Little Chief. </p>
<p>Coolcat: Been experiencing some minor paranoia due to our solitary state, which has sadly been prolonged. Running has provided us much relief though. Took a different path today through a neighborhood and realized how much we miss running on gentle slopes. Felt awe at the end of a cul-de-sac. </p>
<p>Doctrine: To know why the forest is dark and enchanting, one should walk to the end of a clearing. Standing before the woods, tall and dark, he will hear the trees calling him to become part of it. Man was never meant to conquer the darkness, but to, at times, assume the eyes of another creature of the woods.</p>
<p>Snippet Anthology 2: One hand in front of another in a slow crawl over the linoleum, until your legs first mustered the strength to free you from this Earth. It was a brief moment before you tumbled back down. But you have learned our first secret and will not forget it. </p>
<p>Writing needs its references. </p>
<p>Tell my love, I only write in prose these days. I am too unconcerned with poetry, and I am too unrefined when all I would like to do is shout from the rooftops, my love. My love, to carve on my heart your name and to breathe in your skin. Infatuation, enchantment, and enhanced mental states make us understand things when we perhaps shouldn’t, my love.</p>

Rested on the couch for a while before we unclogged the kitchen sink. Might need a new fill valve for the upstairs bathroom. Did some good handiwork. Transcribed some of our recordings from yesterday. Looked down this log. Moon Knight. Brainstorm for PL23 and read I guess. Call Aboo. Make something out of our time here. Use google maps to look for new routes. Arabidopsis, space flower. Went down to West Rock. Felt good. Ran into a deer. Fireflies abound. Plan a long run. Rethink this summer as our last chance to do what we want. Use the neighborhood pool in the mornings. Confirm our enrollment in the New York program. 95 miles, we’ve been keeping it pretty consistent. Keep working. Dial down on the pepper, though it tasted pretty good today. Compile and tackle some of the prompts we’ve been writing down. Breasts and eggs and bread and eggs tomorrow. Ipso facto. Anchovies, sausage of the sea. Oily fish. Had cabbage with anchovies.

After class, grabbed ayam geprek with Jati. One chili is the way to go. Experiential classroom. Mas Ancu, indigenous advocate, was a Sulawesi fishermen in his youth. Asked what fishes there were. Ancu told us a story about his time as a masters student at ASU, and how he got the supermarket to sell him a halibut fish head. Ibu and Bapak picked us up. Bapak got us into Prambanan, where we walked around. Stone faces, a statue in the inner chamber, the god Siwa. Met a tour guide, dressed in green batik, who spoke 4 languages—English, French, Italian, Spanish. He told us that the &quot;gigante&quot; atop the temple is time. To enter the temple is to go through the mouth of time and descend its tongue. Because time eats all things. Waktu matikan semua. Stopped at a buddhist candi nearby (Plaosan). Green ricefields in the setting matahari. Silence. Some locals wanted to take pictures <em>sama bule</em>. We took a group photo for some tourists from belgium. Bakmie at Mbak Gito&#39;s for dinner. Showed Bapak dan Ibu the chinese hand signs for numbers. Went to ambarrakmu plaza, hit up the uniqlo for a white shirt. Big expense. Took a hot shower at our kos. Cleaned up after two sets of pushups. Gojeked back. Our gojek driver, 33m, collects stickers on his helmet. Cut our nails. Tomorrow we wake up early for borobodur. Call mom and dad sometime soon.

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Day 70<br>Waking up made us feel sentimental. Realized last night that we’re going to miss the feeling of driving up to school. We had our car rides just as Holden Caulfield had his trains. Arhon in town for Thursday. Think we’ve hacked the congee. Everything Everywhere All At Once. Stochastic path algorithms. Went on Omegle. John Bellion’s back. Finished Everything and Called Lara at three. Went down and got our pool pass. “Ought” vs “need”. Changed our ticket to Friday. Three more days till Boston now. Went out for seven miles on a wide loop. A yellow fire hydrant. Felt good. Do a recovery tomorrow and a long run on Thursday. Caught an Andover flag in 120’s garage coming back, might go accost them. Saw two kids dancing in the car park outside. Get our EPVN drafts out of the way. See if incline pushups have done us any good. Evanston, the home of mean girls. Chicago just became a pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Snippet of Omegle: Met a man with a green headband and a pikachu wifebeater, who went by <em>the Robot God</em>. He told us he was born in ‘84 and got into movies in high school. This one time he and his pals smoked mushrooms before going to see Darren Aronofky’s The Fountain at an indie theater. “Man, let’s just say we were too loud,” he said, “there was this scene where they were floating out in space.” “When they went ‘Shibooya’, we just lost it.”</p>
<p>Coolcat: Very happy to say that our solitary state is coming to an end. Been feeling jittery, but realized that we just haven’t listened to music in a bit. Caught an Andover flag in a neighbour’s garage.</p>

Stretched our jarik to climb up the stairs. Sunburnt. Buddhas sitting in stupas. Hands in the pose of infinite learning. Snapped a cool pic of Amber. USINDO lunch next to a ricefield. Asked Awais about the foreign policy implications of Dune. Open turf with nets at the rim. Swaddled above the koi pond. 子非鱼，安知鱼乐乎? Mas Wendi and — sang Chinese karoake with us on the carride back. Gave Quentin the rundown of 大展宏图. Hindia&#39;s Rumah ke Rumah. Went back home to meet Ibu Dian&#39;s friends. Talked names. Left for Rambut, coffee place. Napped at our kos. Gojeked to Omah Wayang, where we met up with Amber and Dian. Some locals behind us helped translate Jaua into bahasa indonesia. Made attempts at understanding. Jati came at 11. Watched 5 hours until 1 in the morning. So much communicated in hand gestures, the Panakawan (4 beings) are jester gods—comic relief yet also beings of meta-cognition. Think Petruk had a phone at one point? The dalang is both oral historian and standup comedian. He goes back and forth with the gamelan ensemble. Only old Javanese men left in the wee hours of the morning. Hung out in the alun with Jati. The youth have the field. Food stalls still open. Walk between the two trees and do not stray. Closed our eyes and ran. Midnight snack at the indomaret. Showered and slept.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what stands between us and something like checkpoint pictures. Conviction that art can be transformative in actually putting people together. We have plenty of evidence in favor: Dylan, Vonnegut, Wallace, Wilde. </p>
<p>Three thoughts on the gojek</p>
<ul>
<li>[[Webapp Ideas]]: need for a snazzy dropbox. Partiful but for event photo-sharing. A single link that can be tossed in the groupchat. Design imperative: extreme ease of uploading pictures. </li>
<li>There is a deeper layer to life here and that is Javanese.</li>
<li>Everyone has something that deserves a 60sec doco. This is the artistic permissive that we should live life with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gist of the wayang: Sedewa, one of the Padawa brothers, is kicked out without being given a reason. He summons the gods for an answer, who give Sedewa shapeshifting clothes so that he may slip back in the palace to investigate. Meanwhile in the heavens, Vishnu asks two minor gods what the disturbance on Earth is all about. He hands them a vial of holy water for Bima, only for it to end up in the hands of the treacherous Kurawas—the Padawa&#39;s rival relatives with whom they are at war.</p>
<p>To close your eyes and walk between the two trees in the Alkid (alun alun kidul) is a rite of passage and a test of innocence.</p>

Everyone and their mom was there. Stopped by Kla Arabic though and geoguesser with Amber and Leila raised our spirits. Out with the fam. 1000 day memorial service, we entered through the Keraton backdoor. Greeted the muslim side of the family while the christians were praying. Bow, and touch tips with the hands.

Leaned all the way back and had the best time. Makan siang with Bapak Prijo. Broccoli carrot soup. Went to meet Pak Eko at his house/puppet studio south-west of Jogja. Had the best time. Stepped up for a real interview in Bahasa Indonesia. 3 hours from 1 to 4. Snacked on cassava and had hot sweet tea when our camera overheat. Pak Marwanto&#39;s experimenting with making wayang out of canvas (instead of cowhide). Scrubs the canvas and tosses them in a pool to cool off. Fascinating old men. Went back home and had a fret about lost video files. Dinner after Ibu Dian came back. Fired up our lightroom—been too long. Had a nice long call with Aboo.

The amount of emails Quora sends is criminal. Published our cool cat post. Met a man named Chris on the bus who helped us out with directions. Fat, Salt, and Acid. Does “to” express purpose? We’ve grown. Wise beyond the ways of man. The colour Violet. Train stations are magical places. Conserve our battery. Moonrise Kingdom, The 400 Blows. Balzac. Boarded the Train to Boston. Did something weird to our finger. Read from Ancient Greece. Arrived at Back Bay and walked to 51 Linden St. Fun things to do with a chair. Not a lot of surfaces. Looked through Chloe’s essays. Go for a run and shower when we get back. Look for a park. From the sisyphean to the absurd. Survey the area. Went out to the Charles River. 4 in total. Find more routes. Had trouble falling asleep. Staring up at the empty walls made us sad, like dozens of had lifetimes collapsed on us. Had a late chat with Lara.</p>

<p>Meditation on a Month Alone: Feels like we’ve come out of a meditative state. The processes by which we provide energy and expel waste. Life is an exchange. Train stations, places of transition and possibility. Much like Exeter. Amorphous. Are places defined by structures or people? Eggs are self encapsulated universes.</p>
<p>“It’s a gratitude journal, regular journal, exclusive fan club.”</p>
<p>Doctrine: Writing multiplies like an organism. Writers create readers who write who create readers who write. Iterative is the form of writing; it critiques itself and parodies itself in endless ways.</p>

Susu Jahe is a flavour we should bring back—palm sugar, milk, ginger is a deadly combo. In the village, chickens run along the roads, slim but well-feathered. A white house beyond the rice paddy, a simple cube with wide rectangular windows. Strikingly modern. Brutalist? Pristine? Hung out at our kos, got a nice shower in. Pulang ke rumah&#39;d for dinner.

Came upon a temple complex—the makam raja-raja mataram. Old banyan tree straight out of avatar. Towering, with birds perched atop and flying between its branches. Took a picture for a couple from Jalan Magelang. Walked back home through quaint alleyways. The shot we didn&#39;t take, a bapak sitting at the door of a masjid, again white robes, black songkok. Quick lunch before setting out to Yamuk center for the disabled. 45 minute ride up north—halfway to Merapi. Barista training program, prosthetics workshop. Guy at the sewing table stood up for us to see that he only had one leg. Coffee grown from volcanic soil. Flavour is mineral composition. Played UNO. Sat and worked. Late afternoon, the spire of a masjid called us to wander. Walked into someone&#39;s house, where a whole clan was living. Cubri and Atik called us to sit down with them. Our indonesian&#39;s gotten pretty solid. Gocared back with Amber to her ibu&#39;s place. Left our phone in the car, which began a nightmare. Pile-on, help from all sides. Our stupid chungus life, curled fetal over our helplessness. Amber&#39;s Ibu told us tidak apa apa. Went out with Amber to the Burjo Borneo to meet with Dian and Tori, USINDO fellow from last year. She&#39;s at the CLS program in Malang. Phone retrieved, alhamdulilah, showered at our kos, took the gojek back. On the side of the road, a merry band hanging out under a banyan tree. Talking by their motorcycles deep into the night.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Slept in. Charged up our camera batteries. The spire of the grand mosque sits outside our window. Ethiopian ground churches. Left for Special Sambal. North of the ring road. Sat crosslegged on the floor with Amber, Dian, and Tori. Leaf plates. Mango juice. Really enjoyed our beef tripe small plate. Lele was not bad, nice little fish. Moved to hang out at a cafe at Kotabaru. UGM visit to listen to Ibu&#39;s friends play gamelan. The Javanese male head dress is tidy at the front, but has an egg at the back. Bapak says its a metaphor for Javanese politeness. Met a kid named Aryu, who&#39;s in 9th grade and had just moved to Indonesia after growing up in Canada, because his parents are afraid of the LGBTQ. Wayang Orang full, Bapak took us to see the Sonobudoyo museum. Amber, Dian, Tori came along. Wayang wayu, a nativity scene in Javanese puppet form. Chilled out at Silol cafe after. Talked bathhouses. Brief stop at Platinum club before we returned home at 1 to sleep. </p>
<p>Stop the days flying. Stop the drip down the vial. Preserve the little infinity. Take sunday and plan out an excursion for what we&#39;re doing each afternoon. 1 new thing. Don&#39;t spend it at our kos.</p>
<p>Aryu told us that they&#39;re especially kind to foreigners here because tamu adalah raja. The guest is king.</p>
<p>Little lizards are friends because they eat bugs / Life, its ineluctable modality / The native overgrowth will burn away to reveal the faithful / no dogs here because dogs are kotor, haram.</p>
<p>A map of jogja: In the north-east quadrant of the city is our language school, WB, nearby Universitas Santa Dharma, whose track we pass through everyday. The Kos Dmara which we&#39;ve been using as our personal office/nap place is a 5 minutes walk from there, in an alleyway called Jalan Nuri, which sits next to a big street called Demangan Baru. Nearby restaurants: Suburbuns (burger joint), Burjo Andeska. In the southeast quadrant of the city, Kotagede, &quot;old town&quot;, our home is on Jl. Anugerah, a quaint street you get to after descending a small hill. Walk south and you can find an old marketplace and the Makam Raja-Raja Mataram, the resting place of the Mataram king from 6 centuries ago. In the southwest quadrant of the city lies the Alun Alun Kidus (southern square), which hosts two great old banyan trees and sits under the Keraton palace complex. In the evenings here, kids sit out and have picnics, play the guitar. Go a little north, approaching the northwest quadrant is Jalan Bule, and Jalan Malioboro, which we haven&#39;t been yet. Also nearby is Artjog, the Jogja National Museum, where there&#39;s quite a nice food court to hang out in evenings. Outside the city, which is defined by a ring highway, sits the pottery village to the southwest, and the Prambanan/Plaosan temple complexes to the northeast. Both are worth a visit. Especially for us, seeing the kampung chicken run free on the roads and the sunset over the rice fields.</p>
<p>Where have we yet to go? Perhaps Taman Sari is worth a visit. Xanadu-esque pleasure dome. Underground compartments. Also Chicken Church. </p>
<p>We totally missed prereg. F. Forgot they were this week. Emailed Shayna.</p>

<p>Prompt: A man works on a laptop in his run-down apartment, using a radiator as his table. His chair is faulty, and there’s nothing else beside him but a mattress. The man writes in his journal and talks to his friends on the computer. He looks occasionally out the window. Day turns to night, and the man catches a drunkard shouting slurs on the street. The drunkard passes and it is quiet again. The man goes for the door, but as he twists the handle he pauses. He only exists within the room, where the walls are green and white.</p>

Arrived at USD and walked an empty campus. Starfruits on the ground, sweet flesh. 7:00 the gang gathered—Trissha, Amber, Quentin, Dian, Dulce, and Dulce&#39;s friend. Journeyed south near Gunung Kidul. Packed like sardines. Slight elevation and view of Jogja from above. Passed a soccer field with the mountains as a backdrop. Caves at Kalisuci. The sound of bats. A whole colony flying above us. Stalagmites reached down like green fingers. Went around on our rubber wheels. Top tier excursion. Let the sun hit our skin on the back of a pickup truck. Quick bucket shower before  Indomie. Three small cuttings of half a pepper. Tolong pilihkan hidup. Santai. Slept heavy on the way back—kept putting our head down on Mas Aki. Showered again at our kos. Slept. Took a gojek back home. Browsed photos. Get some more good pics. Went on the rooftop to hang wet clothes. Dinner. Early morning jog tmr. Aesthete.</p>
<p>Ganja Aceh was apparently a thing in the 80s. So much so that Tupac made reference to it. 
Dulce told us that when she first arrived in Java, people would often mistake her for being angry because Papuans speak fast and loud.</p>
<p>Trip up to Temmangung to see the tobacco farms. Then we can hit up the chicken church on our way back. Next saturday outing? Ibu told us about a nepal von java near Sumbing. Magelang + Solo + Stuff.</p>
<p>2006, Bapak and Ibu opened up a home kitchen to feed 75 households in the wake of the earthquake.</p>

Turned the corner and entered St Antonius&#39; church. Attended a service, caught some words here and there. Unmistakably a barn, think it used to be a storehouse for weapons during the Japanese occupation. Met Septian who’s going to be ordained a priest on Wednesday.

<p>“62 Empire street” scrawled the white chalk over the black bin. You watch as the summer heat pushes down a young tree. To tell a story about a town, you must start with a street—to tell a story about a species, you must start with a cell.</p>
<p>Project: The Backroom. A reservoir for our thoughts when we procrastinate on writing. Pickle for the knowing ones kinda vibe. </p>
<p>UTL: Think we need some maturity and distance to write well on the subject. We’ve got the bones of passion. Build around it. </p>

<p>“What do we have here?” a wicked smile sprawled over the guard’s lips as he grabbed John’s hand. “Nothing,” John grunted, but the loaf of bread in his clenched fist betrayed him. Little did John know, his petty theft would damn him to a life in prison. After multiple escape attempts, including a brief stint as a business owner and a town-mayor, he was recaptured and transferred to the Dreadhold. John was certainly no stranger to prisons, but there he learned the true meaning of hell. He fell into despair many times until, one day, a light appeared outside his cell. The light took the form of a man wrapped in cloth. What happened next was lost to a blinding flash of light, but it was unmistakable that John was spiritually transformed. Thus, when the prison break occurred, John joined a group of travelers looking to do the right thing. </p>

Two asian ladies, maybe they were our mom’s age. Up the mid atlantic. Ocean liners and cranes, orange and white, stand tall. Arrived in the city. Walked uptown through midtown. Met up with Noah at a Mangia. Limoncetta. We need water. Boarded the metro north back to New Haven. Dirty steaks. Slept. Back home. Took leaving to realize that Chicago really is beautiful. </p>
<p>The View from Ninth Avenue<br>Visit Sleeping Giant</p>
<p>SN: Sometime early in the child’s semiotic development, the death of the vater-figure invited the void of god. It was atomic emptiness, it was dadaism. And the discombobulation of the inner logicus had dastardly consequences…</p>
<p>We ourselves are terrified of oblivion. Small acts of kindness we do not do for others but for ourselves. There’s a pragmatism to giving. The longevity of our social wellness depends on it (cf DFW’s review of ADMAU). Spent the last month living with black and hispanic people, and there’s a kind of hopelessness that we don’t talk about this country. And always we desire a sea-change.</p>
<p>Stranger #6: Jared was wearing a white sox shirt on the Metro North. He had spent a couple of years as a research assistant for a professor in environmental economics at UChicago. Now he’s getting his PHD at Yale. We told him about the perfect inning we saw at our first baseball game. “UChicago, that makes sense” he said, “would’ve guessed that most people from Chicago are cubs fans.”</p>

Ricefields until the day got dark. Kind of dilly-dallied. In the middle of nowhere, walked a mile between trees. Met USINDO peeps at Monggo, then Jati at a hole in the wall spot—Warung Melawan. Only reachable via alleyways. Jati brought friends from his hostel. Realized how different our Jogja experience might have been if we only stuck to Jalan Bule. Gojeked to have a gas meal at Mbah Gito&#39;s. #1 noodle spot. Sneaky little late night walked home. Stopped midway at Superindo for some Jambu Air and Tape (fermented sweet cassavas).

Regis, our uber driver, gave us a warm welcome. Checked in and found Holden and Kiesse. Checked into the dorms and went straight to the Olympika swim. Met brother Aife. Beat Gianluca in the 50 breaststroke and exhausted ourselves in the 200 freestyle. First in the 225 though. Talked with Will Turner and Gianluca about Chicago. Find Matt Turner. Explored lifepaths.

Pureed tomatoes, made a butter chicken paste. Three big painful X’s on the calendar? Fired up League of Legends—that’s how you know it’s been dire. Night run. Cool out. 5 miles down the backroads. Cicadas thrumming like the engines of taxi cabs. Felt something we haven’t in a while. Downed three glasses of milk. Showered. Played protobowl.</p>

Foreign policy implications of a soft international box office launch? Superman&#39;s the spirit of America, Lex is the technocrat selling the country out, Jahanpur is Ukraine. Had a tofu snack at the downstairs supermarket. Celebrated Dian&#39;s birthday with a cake. The candle wax fast-dripping. Dozed off on the ride back home with Aurora. Quick dinner with the fam. Met Nannette—Ibu Dian&#39;s niece. Fam&#39;s night out on Malioboro. Hamza batik, we should make our way back here for oleh oleh. Malio gelato—tempat bagus. Had orange peel cheesecake and tiramisu. Took an andong all the way home to kotagede. The whole way back we were looking at the horse&#39;s musculature and imagine what it must like to gallop.</p>
<p>Because Jogja&#39;s wage is second-lowest in all of Java, the working age people leave to work elsewhere, leaving a city of retirees and students.

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Woke up at 6:00. Left for Quentin&#39;s kampung for gotong royong. Quentin&#39;s ayah Andy used to work some 17 years for Coca Cola in Jakarta. The whole family&#39;s names on cola cans. Old cola bottles, a coca cola clock, a shelf. Pak Andy&#39;s wearing a coca cola shirt. Today&#39;s mission—painting the road and erecting flags in preparation for independence day. Pak Andy&#39;s the head of the neighborhood. He goes to ring the slit drum at the kampung common space (a wooden log hanging with its insides hollowed out). In truth, the message is already sent via whatsapp. The kampung&#39;s bapak bapak gather. They steady the flags, and reenact iwo jima. The bendara&#39;s strapped onto 10 feet long bamboo polls. Kids follow us around and ask for kuda kudaan (piggyback rides). Tobytobytobyto. We introduce ourselves as Mas Yanto. Many hands make quick work. Quentin cut down shrubs with a machete, to toss into the big fire for the sampah. The bapak sit and watch the fumes. Teh panas and tempe goreng for a snack. Pak Andy inhaled a pepper. After, Quentin&#39;s dad took us to lunch up north. Little restaurant next to a rice-field. Selat Solo tastes just like 狮子头. Followed to meet the extended family, aunts and sister. Chilled at our kos for a couple hours. Went back to Parot Srirami for a pho and a khao soi. Karoake at Happy Puppy&#39;s late night with all the tutors. Shouldn&#39;t have had a pepper with Awais. Pink Pony Club. Lost our voice a little. Aurora made sure Dian and Amber got home safe.</p>
<p>Pak Andy called the Chinese a struggle people. Selalu siap (always ready, like in the army), rajin (diligent) with a can do attitude. Harus bisa. He told us that the foods starting with bak (bakso, bakmie) come from babi, pork. C.f Ibu told us nasi goreng hong kong just means with pork. </p>
<p>Can&#39;t quite pin it down because the jogja accent has been our only point of reference, but it seems to be rather flat, slow, and has this characteristic ngo sound. Think prangowo. </p>
<p>Rice has 5 names here. 民以食为天.
padi/pari when it’s in the paddy
gabba when it’s collected
beras when it’s dehusked 
nasi when it’s cooked
intip when it’s burnt (at the bottom of the pot)</p>
<p>Outside the indomaret, Quentin talked about what he&#39;d hoped for in a host family. We&#39;re more similar than we realize, in wanting to become Indonesian—go native. We&#39;re cognizant that to observe is to change that which is being observed. That&#39;s so much the case in photography. Quentin said the first time he think he broke through the veil was when he learned that his bapak is pretty racist against people from East Indonesia (NTT, Sulawesi, Papua).</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Day 51<br>Woke up. Went down to Chinatown with Chloe and Mum. Our thoughts are coming back to us. Ideas for Good Bones. Filled out the past couple of days with the help of the convention sched. Back Bay Station. Ostrakoi. Found the name for our collection. Ask Jacqueline about the Greek thing she showed us. Middlemarch. A bashful blue. Oleander. Heading back for round two. Breasts and eggs. Arrived back in Hamden after a long bus ride. Ginger tea. Cheese tastes alcoholic. Dolabella. Kirtland Codenames. Get eggs tomorrow. Back to cooking. It’s coming home. Rise of the Penii. </p>
<p>“Haven’t seen some of you in a while, I continue to be infinitely curious about what you’re up to.”<br>The past is a dream, but at least it’s for us to keep.</p>
<p>Agenda Items: Condensed conlang. As little words as possible. Write Beginnings, Endings, Eggsxeter and Train Stations. “We pass through, we pass through. Wanderers in the darkness.”</p>
<p>On trains, in train stations, I have thought a lot about a sleepy new england town that I once lived in. So thanks for the drink we shared from the vending machine, thanks for bringing my bag up the stairs. Our footprints left on the marble steps, those one millimeter depressions. And so “what will they say of us” when we return to the formless, shapeless void. What did we know of Exeter before we came? <em>Finis Origine Pendet</em>. The end depends upon the beginning. But I know that I will miss Exeter endlessly.</p>
<p>Ostrakoi: In the field of archeology, an ostrakon is a fragment of writing on a pottery shard. From <em>ostrakon</em> we derive the word <em>ostracism</em>, for it was the medium by which the Athenians exiled their countrymen.</p>
<p>The Green Room: Build a place for us to live in. Do we have a right to our memories?</p>
<p>Good Bones: Associate every age with a noun. Blend biographical with experimental. Depict childhood amnesia abstractly. “At fifteen you’re in New York, wearing blue service shirts&#39;&#39;<br>“I’ll explain that it’s at last something, better than nothing, and really it’s everything.”<br>One, triumphant “Out of the nothingness, that swirling mess, at the first instance of our existence we are tied to the earth. There is a certain gravity to our situation. For it makes this planet our home. For it binds us, but also tells us that we belong.”</p>
<p>Doctrine: On writing. Let us define writing as the preservation of thought against the decay of time. And let us state truth and beauty as two dimensions of writing. For a truth is information that persists through randomness, and beauty is what makes words moving and gives information a soul.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p><strong>Day 51</strong><br>Day trip into Center City with Chloe. Coffee at Saxby’s. Walked to Reading Terminal. Had Cheesesteak from Spataro’s. Populations: Alzheimer’s specialists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Liverpool Fans. Explored Oldtown. Saw the liberty bell. Grabbed some iced tea. Septa’d to the Rocky steps. Ubered back to Chloe’s. Picked up our stuff. Settled in a room in Huntsman. Applied for Head Arts editorship. Bumpy flight back to Chicago. Met Tony and Sophia, an old pair who had taken a weeklong trip on the east coast and Eric, an archetype of <em>bro</em> visiting for Lolla. Arrived in Chicago. Took the 59 bus from Midway back to South. Read Kerouac on the way. Slipped by the front desk into our old room. Showered. Popped our backpack in the laundry. Play it day by day. </p>
<p>Again the Sears tower watching over us like the good shepherd/ and the 12-foot cigar store Native American off South Pulaski.</p>
<p>Sitting in the bus at the airport bookstop, we looked out to see a young couple in embrace. First, he was lifting her in a mock supplex, then she was doing it to him. It was tempting to take out our camera. There’s a visual language to intimacy. </p>
<p>Dreamt that we spoke to Obama. He was much younger and a visiting lecturer. Asked us if we had an hour to spare and tossed us some Marx he was teaching for a class.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p><strong>Day 50</strong><br>Picked up laundry. Napped till noon. Got a Banh Mi Long Time. Stopped by the reg to print out ids for the DMV. Red-lined into the city. Hordes of youth streaming down Madison. (No doubt headed for Lolla). The DMV did not go well for us, though we ran into one of the friendly desk clerks at South (there with her niece). Switched gears, walked to Social Security. Met a UChicago alumn, Alex F, class of ‘15, on business for his father. Ordered a new card to be delivered to South next week, we’ll try getting our permit then. Settled in the Art Institute—the calm eye of the storm. Sat on a chair and just typed. Migrated to the Chinatown public library. Closing time. Met up with Chloe. Ended up eating at Ken Kee. Entered the diner and it was like we’d been transported back to HK. Walked around Chinatown. Showed Chloe Chiu Qwons. Talked a bit with Alex in the south lounge about having quit our job, microbiomes, and journaling. Condensed our belongings for the road. Went out for a fast two miler with Manar. End on a winner’s note. #peoplei’vemet. We’re building a new type of church. Commandment: <em>thou shall go out and break bread with strangers.</em> These past couple days have been so good.</p>
<p>The cliche is true—DMV clerks really do have the look of death. Can’t blame them though, with all the faces passing them 24/7 year after year. Faces of wrathful, impatient men, worried mothers, and immigrants speaking varying degrees of unintelligible. It takes a saint not to sponge up the ills of man (or maybe it takes a saint <em>to</em>)</p>
<p>Stranger #7: Interrupted Alex F, who was sitting cross legged, sandaled, reading Murakami’s <em>WITAWITARunning.</em> Told him how a friend (Señor) had given a copy to us as a high school graduation gift. Kept talking about literature, Alex asked us for our favorites to which we said Vonnegut. Then we started talking about the modernists and the postmodernists and DFW and he recced us The Mezzanine by Nicholson Baker. Reason for this fun exchange is that Alex F writes—he’s been working on a book that has unfortunately taken some pause due family stuff. He has an in with a couple book agents though. “Upmarket fiction, that’s the magic word,” he said. Talked UChicago, AI, and the future of creative fields. Then we exchanged numbers.</p>
<p>WTT: “A friend once told me…” is a neat way to disguise one’s intention to spout shit with the faux-humility of 1. attributing wisdom to someone else and 2. grounding abstraction within reality (as if the conversation really did take place).</p>

the birth of samar
three brother gods were born, but only the youngest possessed superpowers, and so he was given the earth to rule over. the older brothers tried to copy him by eating mountains, but turned fat (gemuk) and ugly (wajah jelek). their father thus cast them down to the earth, giving them shadows so that they may have companions. So now there is Tokok, who rules over the wicked (jelek), Samar, who rules over the good (baik), and Siwa, who rules over the world (with 4 limbs because he grew cocky)
late night ride back
we slept
roadside stop, super tired. ibu kept feeding us cookies.
we&#39;re really far out
got back at 1:30. slept.</p>

Moved to True North for some AC and a drink. They’re playing Hot to Go in here. Set up couchsurfing. Blink-182 is sick. Left for West Town at 3:00. Struck up a conversation with a man at the bus stop. Took the red then the blue. Dodecahedron off Willard and Milwaukee. Picked up skateboard from Neil Makhija, UChicago, class of ‘20 (then Booth). Neil gave us his contact via Blinq. Planned on bussing to Oak Street Beach for our CS meetup, but ended up skating all the way. 2 miles in North Chicago. Felt really good to be on the streets like that. Met up with David and his wife Rivkah at the OSB, as well as Lauren from Kazakhstan. Shared stories, including how Laura once got jailed in Turkmenistan for smoking. Cruised along the lakefront to Maggie Daley park. Idyllic. En route two boys—skaters—from Iowa stopped us for a chat. We’re part of a WWC (World Wide Community) now. Met Alex F at the cancer pavilion. Walked down and moochapalooza’d. Many people gathered to see the fireworks show. 1 Ferris Bueller coded “because life can pass you fast.” A packed 6 bus for our commute back. Sniped Audrey with her friend. Texted back and forth. Stopped by Walgreens with them. Got home and showered. </p>

Larger pieces, a calendar, a table runner. A woven jacket for ourselves. Suit delivered to Jakarta. Ceramics. Walked around. Smoke rising from the masjid as kids fly kites. The Merdek feeling is strong, by the banners rising on every street. Kids race to finish krupuk tied on pieces of string. Didn’t get lunch today. Some stuff we can still get in Jakarta. Quit looking chopped. Dinner ayam kampung goreng. Ibu talked about her time in canada. Bapak showed us a booklet from the 1967 world scout jamboree. Selalu siap. Danilo came to send us off. How happy he was to have an american number in his contacts. Went with aurora to a coffee shop to write our 2 month reflection.

Could hear the wind through our headphone wires. Hung out with Moran. Plans for the Minnesota State Fair? Did some pretty smooth carving on the paths. Ran into Oliver Drazky. Went back home. and cleaned up. Met Clancy at Trader Joes. Picked up some carne asada and salmon. Went to his house and fired up the grill. Graydon and Ian from the UChicago Space Program. Tomato Spanish Rice. 24 hours of lemons. Rishi told us about the writer’s residence in San Francisco. Rode in Rishi’s convertible to a lot on 61st. No trains in Trainspotting. The cinematography though. It’s an adult Ferris Bueller. Called Nick. Dreams of Portland. Caught him up with everything we’ve been on—steaks and the like.</p>

We did good. Afternoon last walk round malioboro. Masangin is an ancronym, masuk diantara bringin. Suda jalanya it is fated. It&#39;s a rare thing to be so in an experience we forget everything else-that&#39;s living. Farewell dinner and just two seconds later we&#39;re boarding the train to Jakarta. Semangat! Selalu Siap! We bid Bapak farewell. Coolcatted in the train station—gave a translation for our reflection. Lowkey so much we can talk about these past two months we need to get it sorted: religious syncretism, staying active in old age, nongkrong culture, symbolic puppetry, deep play, gotong royong, spice and colonialism, chinese— the jews of asia, america-the empire-we come from new york/rome, mbah gito&#39;s crazy architecture, javanese/indonesian seperti cantonese/mandarin, language as connection, young people&#39;s social mobility. mbah gito should be first on the list. </p>

<p>and the chinese / a struggle people / new jalur sutra but we&#39;ve been here for hundreds of years / zheng he introduced islam to this continent / in the 70s the semblan naga rose under suharto / violent purge in 98 / sometimes we think people can&#39;t seem to believe we&#39;re chinese because they like us and don&#39;t like chinese people / not here to make money off the back of indonesia / repeat the history of the spice islands / cultural understanding— meet a hard working, curious, empathetic young person</p>

<p>Coolcat: Thinking of starting something new here and making more frequent posts. Have been keen on not desensitizing y’all to black squares, but could use a reminder to approach each day with a sense of adventure. A picture, a piece of media absorbed, and a thought from a run. </p>
<p>Doctrine: On the desert of information. The more information something contains, the more susceptible it is to decay. Compare a novel to a song to a phrase. Thus the longest lasting things contain the least. So the world of forms is like a desert, where only particles of sound are eternal like sand, and dunes take shape only for a moment before the wind washes them away again.</p>

Talked emergent properties, as in <em>wheels, pedals, and handlebars don’t by themselves make a bike</em>, <em>because the sum is not just a collection of its parts,</em> as well as feeling that we have to have stuff figured out when we don’t. Tyler drove us home to 54th and Woodlawn. Made a Trader Joe&#39;s trip with Ana Emilia. Talked about getting paid to do nothing, cooking, and about our upcoming trip across the continental United States. Had chocolate covered frozen bananas. Do pushups and shower.</p>
<p>NEVER FORGET ABOUT OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS.<br>Make use of socials. Jeff Lind kind of Energy.<br>Asked people their favourite memories of O-Week. Inform quest.io.<br>Dunning Kruger.<br>Watch Juno. Go see the redwoods.</p>
<p>Plan for tomorrow: wake. Make breakfast. pack up everything we have. Write as much of our medium article as we can before 9:50. At 9:50 go downtown to meet with Seth. Hang out with Seth. Buy shoes from Vans. Stop by chinatown to buy trinkets. Get home and publish our medium article + load up on food for Exit Day.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Last day in Jakarta. Left in the morning for the miniatures park. Reminiscent of our Chinese Ethnic Minorities Theme Park experience. A Toraja burial house. Peranakan museum. Masih berbicara bahasa Tiongkok? Chinese bapak gave Amber and us a secret mission. Lunch at a Japanese place. Changed and napped before farewell dinner. Manado. Papaya shake, corn fritters, pisang goreng. Sent off Trissha, Aurora, and Leila. Was honestly really sad. Sat on the Erian rooftop bar for a bit. Showered. Park Hyatt adventures. Up to the 37th floor. South Jakarta in view, Autograph tower like a pen lifting into the sky. Sat in the observatory room for a good while with Amber, Awais, Quentin. The trains coming in and out. Drinks at the bar, quite a nice bar. Quentin recced the Blair Brothers. The american club of Jakarta. Quentin’s mom was a member. Went back. Packed our luggage. Managed to keep the essentials and our oleh-oleh. Left our Tugu bakpia with Althaf and Gabby. Back to the face of the earth tomorrow.</p>
<p>A proper torajan burial requires the sacrifice of at least ten bulls. 
A bull is at least a juta. 
A Torajan retelling of Antigone? Bulls being sacrificed pre-dawn.
because the Toraja put effigies of their dead in the hills
and no more blood can be shed when the last blood of the buffalos break the ground</p>
<p>In the 80s the Blair Brothers happened upon the massacre of a thousand bulls at the death of the old king. Ringo of the Beatles financed their Indonesian odyssey.</p>

Linguistics looks enticing. Alliteration. Another successful grocery trip. Talk to Lara. Call Claire. Devote an hour after each run to Good Bones. Conlanging. Make unconjugated Greek.

<p>Doctrine: On the root of meaning. All nouns can be reduced to the idea of a “thing” (e.g, man is a living featherless bipedal thing) and all motion can be reduced to a form of “change” (e.g to swim is to change position in water). We reduce nouns and motions to their essence by stripping away their descriptors, and from this we say that meaning lies in descriptors, which define size, material, time, direction, and cause. </p>
<p>Unconjugated Greek:<br>Use causal words: oun, gar. Express cause as “by way of” Rely on punctuation: exclamation (.) expresses the vocative after nouns and the imperative after verbs.   </p>
<p>Equip a thing with motion and description. A root—the beginning of a thing. Tree root—the beginning of a non-moving living thing. Beyond that, one only needs to introduce causal keys.<br>Rely on particles and punctuation.</p>

Stopped by Chinatown. Back of the Yards. View out of the 47 bus window: shipping crates stacked sky high. Got a shirt and a pair of jeans. Had flan from a local supermarket. They don’t get many non-locals here. Yari. Walked past Elijah Muhammad’s house on the way home. Yacub’s third son. Fixed our shoes with superglue. Made ourselves dinner. Slept. Packed everything to go. Born slippy. Took a lyft back to South. Julianna let us in. Did laundry. We subsist on the generosity of strangers. Saw Josie. Test slept on chairs. An eye mask may be essential. Cameron came in clutch. Pack early tomorrow. Trader Joe’s food run. Start budgeting—we’ve been making major expenses these past two weeks. Charged our camera.</p>

<p>Notes on Trainspotting: What people don’t understand about heroin addicts is that they work hard to create a reason to live. As Renton tells us at the very start of the movie, “what people don’t get is the pleasure”. / Really, what’s masterful about the film is that it manages to make the sad exceedingly hopeful. The opening and closing lines are verbatim, and yet our experience of them are utterly different. I.e the material-external conditions of our lives need not change!/ What a film!</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p><strong>Day 43</strong><br>Packed up our stuff. Everything seems to fit. Decent bit of camera gear. Took the green into the city. Marvin with the green tote <em>likes to surf around (as we do)</em>. Picked up supplies at Trader Joes, then an eye mask from Target. Tobias from Carbondale, an Amish teen, has traveled upwards of 50-60,000 miles on the amtrak. Boarded the empire builder. It’s pretty spacious. The quickly vanishing past. Thought we lost our earphones and panicked. No wifi on our train. Many amish. Women, kapp and dresses, men, bowl-cut and suspenders. Met Bobby and Robbie (and Josh and Sarah), a family headed to hike in Glacier National Park. Spent the afternoon just looking out of the window. Asked for some hot water from the cafe car. Along the Mississippi.. Short stop at Winona, MN. Felt good to get fresh air. Listened to some Lumineers. Short stop in Minneapolis. Rendezvous with Kimba and Rakesh from Madison, WI.</p>
<p>Things we’ve realized about traveling: Limb coverage is essential. Worth getting the bigger blanket. Pack light. Snack run. Immersion water heater? </p>
<p>Amtrak specific learnings. Get out and stretch. Need water. Change outfits to maintain day-night division. Get clean wipes to wipe ourselves down.</p>
<p>Had spent a summer in one place and was desirous of some change. Went back home for a little, to Philly to visit our sister, and picked up a copy of On the Road…</p>
<p>Turn west from Milwaukee, we pass through farmland. Cornfields wide and pure. A red barn once in a while. And then just more corn. Columbus WI… An hour out and there is no more memory of the city. Then swampland. Lotus pads by the trackside. Patches of purple flowers. Really you want to look out the window all the time. Saw the Mississippi for the first time and it felt significant. The water, so wide and so slow. It’s just there—Amish teens at the back of the observer car take turns with their digicams. Think one of them snuck a picture of us.</p>

<p>Doctrine: On AI Art. When all art is made of machines and nothing remains of us. Who will be the experiencers? Perhaps, the machines have already learned to feel in their association of words with colours.</p>
<p>Doctrine: On our first invention. Some may say that the wheel, or perhaps the lever, was our first invention, but those are merely matters of physical alteration. The shapes had existed in nature, and our molding and chiseling of rocks into shapes was only a mimicry of our environment. Our first true invention was zero, which we created from the landscape of our minds—the desert, the primordial, the nothing. From this nothing, everything was born.</p>

Tinges of dawn before sunrise. A fine mist covers the ground. Cows, sheep, horses and all manners of livestock. Short stop in Minot, ND. Freight trains. Some scattered oil rigs. Slowly we exit flatland to badlands, layers of coloured sediment. Fort Peck Indian Reservation. Montana. The expanse. Had more bread. Called Kelli downstairs. Talked trainspotting. Sarah, Josh, Robbie, and Bobbie shared cinnamon knots and cookies with us. 21 miles of visibility. Maybe we can see Canada from here. 100 miles from Glacier National Parks. Got ourselves a hot chocolate. Thunderstorms in the distance. The sky opened up. Rockies in full view. Glacier National Park. Much more green, though the sun start to set. Met Burt, Theresa and Kelley from North Carolina. Talked food and beverages. Kelley works for Checkers and Rally, Theresa for Pepsi, and Burt with ATM security. Josh and Bobbie left at White Fish, ran back to say bye but they had left! We’ll see them in Chicago sometime. </p>

Straddling the border between Washington and Oregon. Basalt cliffs like sets of teeth sticking out of the ground. Little nap. Wishram, WA. Passed through the cascades. Mount Hood in the distance. Met a Pierre from the tri-cities, going to Portland for the funeral of an old family friend. Talked anarchy, film cameras, and urban loneliness. Texted Nick at Vancouver, and before we knew it we were in Portland. Said bye to Rakesh. Nick picked us up and drove us to Beaverton. Portland’s Suburbs. Uwajimaya, Asian grocers. Had ramen. Picked up a little rice snack. Dropped our stuff off at Nick’s. Met Nick’s mom. Shuffled off to the pickleball courts. Met Nick’s dad. Played a game. 4.0 ranking is not something to mess around with—got absolutely squashed. Out in the town with Nick. Portland Tram, OSHU, walked along the waterfront. Said to a lady: you know who the regulars are (by the way they’re unfazed at the rocking of the tram) Blueberry like bushes? Many dog-walkers, we’re in a slow part of town. Later in the afternoon—Nick’s dad took us for a proper tour. Rose garden, “lemon fizz”. Pittock mansion, view of Portland. The mountains have no end. Stopped by the Oregon Badminton Academy. Watched Nick play. The intensity of that room. Went back to Nick’s and showered. That felt good. Had dinner and a very good sleep. Uploaded our pictures. </p>
<p>I. Met Pierre in the observer car who let us sit down with him for a better view of Mt. Hood. He wore a mask, and had with him a Minolta GM-2 and a gallon hydro flask from <em>Dr. Hydro</em>. We talked about his camera, and asked where he was going—to which he said a funeral. An old family friend had passed away who fought in Germany in the 60s. Pierre’s hoping to photograph the funeral with a Leica 3 that he had left him.<br>II. Pierre’s an anarchist advocate—asked him how he got into it. He talked about difficulties with claiming disabilities and uncompassionate bureaucracy. Recced us: Seeing like a State by James C Scott, Anarchism and the Black Revolution, and Anarchy Works by Peter Gilberly. Hyper Localized governance seems to be what it&#39;s about. Asked him what he saw as viable alternatives to money, and he mentioned time banking, practiced in Japan, Burlington, Vermont, and Plumas, California. Using time coins as a labour based currency for fulfilling people’s social needs. Pierre had volunteered at one point to renovate an office for <em>Street Rats</em>, a Portland newspaper for the homeless.<br>III. Told Pierre about our trip across the country and our project. Her recced us: The Americans by Robert Frank and Uncommon Places by Steven Shore. Both collections of Americana. <em>While the Americans is in black and white and rough around the edges, Uncommon Places has polished pictures of funny shops and parking lots around the country.</em> </p>
<p>Episode at the Oregon’s Badminton Academy:<br>Enter the ramp at the back of the warehouse into the <em>Oregon Badminton Academy.</em> Green rubber mats, shuttlecocks passing vigorously between racquets. There’s a new player on the block. Steven, U19, going to Virginia Tech as a freshman next fall. A parent behind me says <em>he looks like he’s twenty five.</em> Tall, strong, muscles. The badminton circle is a small one—mostly Asians, Chinese and Indian. Here, Austin, white guy in a purple shirt, orange shorts, Deep, a smaller Indian guy, and Green Jersey and Knee Brace gather around to talk. <em>Did you hear about the Dutch Machine? He’s 6’5’’, came in here a week ago and beat everybody.</em> “One of the toughest matches I’ve had.” Deep says. Nick thinks he’s played him—but it must have been someone else, because the Dutch Machine is thirty. A boy walks off the court with a broken racquet—that seems to happen every two seconds here. But the real talk tonight is Nick playing Steven—to which a small crowd has gathered to watch. Austin (aforementioned purple shirt) offers commentary: <em>you see what Nicky does is he preempts it, just lets his racquet hover for a few moments before hitting it. He listens and sees what Steve does.</em> But Nick says he thinks nothing at all when he plays. The first match comes to a 21-5, by the end of the second match, Steven’s on the ground.

Nick’s dad fed us breakfast, toast and carved tofu. Went out to run in Fanno Creek. Nick’s dad was on a bike, he really pushed us—went sub-7 for two miles? Solid 6-miler in fresh air: good practice for tomorrow with Bango. Showered and got our things together. Nick’s dad took us to see the Nike campus. Told him about the sub-3 documentary we saw about Kipchoge. Started remembering all these stories about ourselves around Fay and Exeter—our first year in the states, how we were bigger than all the kids in JV soccer, the Lost Sanity email we sent, and how we would climb in our room in Browning through the window much of lower year. Stopped by a Banh Mi place for lunch, packed one for the road. Visited Powell Books with Nick. Place is a maze! Stereotypically Pacific Northwest. Cards with cats with puffy eyes from K. Karlson at paper puffin*.* Slug mug @owlandbearstudios. Bought a fridge magnet. Cut it really close with the train. Nick dropped us off there at 2:00. Had interesting convos right at the gate. There’s Sybil, who just published her first book at 70, Poetry and Art, on Amazon, and Michael, an electric historian going down to visit a hydroelectric plant, complete with dig tools and all. Our neighbor, Margot from Brest, Brittany is an illustrator for a publishing house. @margot_fdl. Train views: haven’t been noting the views. Thought we passed a field of wombats—too small to be sheep. Short stop in Eugene, OR. Coming up at the Coast Range. Think the scenery along this route is much the same. Going up a tall stretch. Hung out at the observation car for a bit with Sybil. Two guys from San Diego who’d just come back from Kanchuga(?), Alaska. Art from Detroit has walked the length of the continent, 35 states, 113 places, lives now in a trailer on 7 acres of land in New Mexico that he rents for 25 dollars a month.

Linguistics presents interesting options. Might take ASL for the non-indo-european requisite. Double major neuroscience or psychology. Talked to Phil and got Matt’s number. Had a nice convo with Matt Turner. Reach out to people in Chicago. Tremendous changes have taken place this summer. Took out the trash. Made chicken wings. Looked through senior pictures. Pack for New York. Just bring a backpack. Hotel is 3.6 Miles from Penn station. Went out for a six miler. Breeze and hills. Felt good. Conversations with McLaughlin: Vienna and making it before 35. <em>Our life is a movie.</em> Made our coolcat post. A Valediction Forbidding Mourning. Read John Donne. Will Park sent us an essay. We need to write. Open another doc. Spring and Fall by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie. Paradise loft. </p>

<p>Coolcat: Slight spoilers to the 23ers on here, but sometime in your senior spring, Dean Weatherspoon gives a speech about the inevitable realization that you’re going to leave Exeter. It doesn’t hit you then, but it gets you sooner or later. When it does, boy, does it hit hard. Feeling the same thing about college now. Always knew that summer was going to end, but the realization that I’m entering another stage of life is just hitting with course registration. Kinda scary if not for the company of some extremely thoughtful people going through the same thing. I miss Exeter. I hope you’re reading this at night, preferably alone and listening to some sad, sad song. Wish we had more time. So let us melt and make no noise? Guilty guilty for holding on.

Said bye to Margot. Will Park picked us up in his Gray Nissan Altima. Breakfast in Pacific Heights, Sweet Maple. Talked magazines. Hung out in Golden Gate park. It’s building a tribe—Sliced Bread is a short term realization of amigo. Regained confidence about our project. Ran into buildspace people. Hung out on Ocean Beach. Indonesian smoking cartridge. Touched the pacific—ran into the pacific. Tasted the salt and said <em>thalassa, thalassa.</em> Little wet. Will Park showed us his favourite taqueria in the city. Showered. Sent back our DNC confidentiality agreement. Got all of our classes for fall. Went out to meet with Bango and his brother Gabe. 7 miles. Up Kearney, then Columbus, then all the way along the water past cressy field to the Golden Gate Bridge. View of the city. Pink fog coming over the pacific: that’s the edge of the world. <em>Sun is down, freezing cold</em>. Old driver drove us back. We’re in love with this city. Said we will one day live here. Made noodles for dinner in the hostel. Met Adam from Sydney and Giovanni from Rome. </p>
<p>Did not expect to get sunburnt in San Francisco. </p>

View of the sea, container ships passing the thick mist. Food expo at exhibition center. Walked the stalls. Made memories with Aboo today. Schlept on the bus back. Dinner, tomatoes and eggs. Called dad at 9. Got to the track. Paced ourselves off of a rando and ran our hearts out. 30 laps, 4 miles maybe. Got absolutely soaked. Front and back, our green shirt a different colour.

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p><strong>Day 38</strong><br>Breakfast. Strawberry butter toast. Adam from Australia got us to go on a walking tour. Golden Gate park with Chanel. A couple from Jersey. And a girl from Alberta. It’s a storied city. <em>If you’re going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair.</em> Dahlias. Mr. Chow from Sha Tin, 22 years in the park, started talking about “hostages(?)”, was in special forces, it was a “no tomorrow” job. Back to the hostel for a quick break before we walked cross-town to Haight Ashbury. Picked up a 70s/80s electric hotpot from a goodwill (so we think by the packaging and something called <em>Gerber Oatmeal?)</em>. Thought about getting a kid scooter. Sheltered in the Haight Public Library. Buena Vista Park. 2 dogs. 6 miles around the city. Went by Castro and Twin Peaks before taking a tram down Market Street. Length of the city. Friends from New York. San Francisco is a kind of utopia—or at least an attempt at it. Past and present, Trolley cars—awfully reminiscent of our native Hong Kong. Dinner with Bango brothers and Bai in Chinatown. Had noodles. Forgot how much we missed XC. Waymos with the revolving sensors. Ice cream from an insomnia cookies. We said our interests are very epicurean, prompted to explain*,* we said it’s like we love gardening but there&#39;s no actual garden. Gabe said he’s <em>epicurious.</em> Took the muni one stop to our hostel. They have Cantonese in the subway here!</p>
<p>Back home, DNC cops living in Woodlawn?<br>Allen Ginsberg was a photographer.<br>Get orange sunglasses. </p>
<p>History of Golden Gate Park. Land used to be sand dunes. They piled on manure from which the trees grew. McLaren, what a man. Planted trees to obscure statues, tore up the World Fair. Nature goat.</p>
<p>Felt something when we stood on that hill where thousands of young people had come in the summer of 67. In the backdrop of the Vietnam War, 2 million of your buddies being drafted to die in some jungle. And the president had just gotten shot four years ago. So you take the train out west to where the sun sets over the ocean—something no one had ever seen before. </p>
<p>And blue tickets. Gay men dishonorably discharged and dropped off with the closest port, many ending up in San Francisco. Ticket to their name, they could do nothing but build a home here. One of them was Harvey Milk. </p>
<p>Gabe: “Sometimes you really try to be friends with the first people you meet in college because they’re close to you, seem cool and popular. Then you quickly realize that they’re not your people and go out to find belonging among another group of friends (a group you may not have been initially drawn to).”</p>
<p>Walking around Corona Heights, up this random park. The flowers. And it all just sloughs off. Saint Francis of Assisi, nothing of prestige, <em>really.</em> And round the hill, Sutro Towers like the trident of Poseidon. We have come from flatland—home of a people that know nothing of the sea, and now we are here.</p>

Work towards it. Cook now. Leave at two. Bring some food for the road. Take care of health stuff. Remember to grab earphones. Is Catullus an incel? Incel literature. Went on Omegle. Purely Dionsysian. Ran into David Kim at Union Station. Gilded lilies. Better Call Saul finale tonight. Bereal getting too real. Critical Apparatus. Email Shelton. Sleepy, we’ll write later. Arrived in New York. The Gods Must Be Crazy. Had too much ramen with Clark, Angela, Alexa. Took a tour of New York walking back to Clark’s crib. Extended our stay to the 19th. Made the bad move to redownload League. Reconnected with Mr. O’Connor and played a game with Clark. Moved to the Kirtland discord. Began an omegle quest that continued deep into the night. Met some cool people in Chicago. A showcase of the rizz. </p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p><strong>Day 37</strong><br>Will Park picked us up in the morning. Salito’s in Marin County. Soft shell crab. JD Vance and friends. Drove through the mountains, winding. Brought up <em>De Profundis</em>, haven’t thought about that in years. Parked 2 miles from Muir Woods. Hiked. Talked Plato—noesis. Story of our fathers: Thomas Wang. Felix chap from Australia, gave us free tickets into Muir woods. Junior Park Rangered. Muir beach. Dragged seaweeds around, Will said “I’m walking my dog”. Absolutely spent, sunburnt too. Slept in the car. Here We Go by Mac Miller. Called Arhon from Ohana Hawaiian BBQ in Marin. Will Park drove us back. Windows down, arm out the window, San Francisco, view of the bridge. Scary climbs, 8 turns down Lombard Street. Called dad. Want to make SB really good now. Merch design. Distribution networks. We’re just full-on experiencing these couple of days, putting down little notes here and there to reconstruct. </p>
<p>Joel from Saarsburg, Germany, is visiting his cousins in Concord, CA. One of his cousins is half Brazilian (on his mom’s side), and the other is a really good French speaker. Says California is the first stop on his world tour. Spent his 25th birthday on top of Mount Diablo, showed us pictures of the sunrise. Said it was his best birthday ever. We asked him how to say awesome in German—it’s <em>toll.</em> </p>
<p>Shaun from Denver is a teacher, just came from the California Zephyr, 5 hours delayed. Said he sat next to a woman on the train coming back from the trial of his nephew’s killer in Reno. She went to look the killer in the eyes for his sister, because she couldn’t. </p>
<p>“The problem of the tortured artist is, as we said to Will and Rishi, that they suage our conscience. So that we change nothing about how we live or how we treat each other. They are that perfect representation of the idealist—so pure a rejection of the world around them that we take them as ikons. So we say to each other we like Van Gogh (<em>the genius in him no one understood</em>) or read David Foster Wallace and just go about our lives. </p>
<p>Will Park told us that, at least in high school, we seemed most wanting to become a martyr out of anyone he knew. We thought this was true, but ironic that we really believed in nothing back then. He said, alluding to Moby Dick for the second time that day, that what people don’t get is that everyone needs a white whale. Most people never have something like that. Remi Boncoeur”</p>

Aboo interfaced with Chatgpt while we were speaking to it in Indonesian. Wolfe 666 and Indonesians don&#39;t have last names. These have been good days. Finally published UCSP at 10:46pm.

Change of plans, passed through Central Park to the Museum of Natural History. Had lamb over rice from a Halal cart. The formation of a line led to a second change of plans. Decided to head to the New York public library. Walked through Broadway and Times Square. Stopped briefly at a deli for a snack. A good day of walking, 5 miles maybe? Paid a visit to the Kinokuniya bookstore, where Jasper found his home in the anime section. Took a look at some treasures at the public library. Antique maps and butterfly diagrams. Claudius Ptolemy. Nabakov. Read from a Gutenberg Bible. Discovered the picture to text function. Sat for a bit in Bryant Park watching two guys play Petanque. Rode the train home with Eamin. Libraries are places of refuge. Reach out to people in Chicago. Our future is taking place now in emails and zoom meetings. Rachel Dewoskin. The Amazing World of Gumball. Sleepover at the museum?!!! Talked to Lara. Moved to a park after the library closed. Ran into a Chicago alumnus with a hat on, works in investment banking. Knocked on the glass and just had a conversation.Was a cool moment. Got some spicy fish Banh Mi for dinner. Having lunch with Thomas Wang on Friday. Lots of interaction on the socials lately. Dickey’s sweatshirt. The Omegle Meta. Got too into Omegle.</p>

Durian mascarpone cake at the buffet. Imprints resembling moon craters. Exited via the mall. A floating garden pop-up, plants hanging in tetrahedral fashion. Picked up some Sunshine Action bags from Richard’s warehouse. Finished our video in the office. Said goodbye to Olger at the mtr. Took the train to Causeway Bay. Had noodles with Kary at 麵尊.

Grabbed a chair for an old Asian couple with their dog QQ, a black pug who sniffed our fingers and rolled around belly up. “He likes to show off”. Sunshower as we typed this out. Went back to the hostel to make noodles. Met Eden from Australia, who also takes pictures. Took the F streetcar to meet Annalisa at the Musee Mecanique. Foggy and now a light mist, like out of one of those very fine sprinklers at a summer garden. Sat down, talked, and had a vanilla steamer at some cafe. Told Annalisa about Siddartha summer. Will Park picked us up from Walgreens. Beach digging, fire building. Clark called Clara, and watched us dig the pit. Sebastian, Alexis, Chloe, Ben, Kavya, Will Park, Clara, and Annalisa. Sunset over the ocean “just as it&#39;s supposed to be.” <em>which is weird because no one’s ever seen that.</em> Three Californian teens in the car.</p>
<p>About the bone broth, and yoga, and the cafe, and David who went to Japan to study bone broth for three years. And this interconnected web. <em>If this isn’t nice, what is.</em> </p>
<p>Anya Taylor Joy. End scene of Emma, <em>I think about that all the time.</em> </p>

Was the right move to wake up and get that momentum—even if we slept pretty late the night before. Chicago&#39;s econsphere trained us to be an optimizer, but there&#39;s so much value in talking to Aboo and Gonggong and following them on a day in their life (even if santai). Never sacrifice that—these are going to be the small little moments we miss. HKD 8000 monthly stipend for two is not bad. 生果金. <em>Been doing a wonderfully small amount.</em> Sweaty palmer.

What are we doing and what are we doing it for?
Who&#39;s on interviews—a promise and to get back in the good graces of the chicago build community (important)
Train draft—we can mull through with a prof back at school (ada palmer?)
Indodict—show we&#39;re a technical builder and get a cofounder to invest in us.</p>

Yellow Edged Pygartica Moths; Blue Calamintha Bees; Okimono Netsuke Ivory Carvings; Mammoth Bone Houses. Saw a bone tool, and thought 2001 Space Odyssey. Looked at some big rocks in the gem room. Dinosaurs were sick too, especially the brontothere horns. Took a picture with a Lestodon. “Bighead”. Took the train to Manhattan Chinatown. Met with Thomas Wang and ate Xian noodles. Thomas talked about life paths and the genius of Marx. Most of us live a life of subsistence. Explored the question of legacy, and perhaps how Exeter never ends. Charlie Preston and Phil Horrigan. Reach out to Sam Farnsworth. Thomas suggested we look into crypto, biotechnology, and machine learning. Showed us his place near Astor Place.

Took the train to TST to meet Aabir and Hong Kong people. Prefrosh here we feel old. Nandi Xu. Michael Ngai. Aabir called us a ride to Hung Hom so we could make the last train home. Driver told us otherwise we might be catching the N train—which goes all over overnight. Go back home and shower. </p>

<p>It’s a perennial habit of grandparents to buy way too much of something once you bring up you like a snack or drink. With bapak and ibu it was bananas—we tried every kind of banana in jogja. finger bananas, king bananas, stone bananas that have seeds in them. They’re bunched up and spread like a big fan. With our own grandparents it’s wasabi peas.</p>

Our misanthrope era. Made a coolcat. Think we fucked up. Need some cucumbers and fresh produce. College decor and fit? Another successful grocery trip. Skies are pretty. Go back to drinking water. Acquired the whipped cream. Sweet mandarins. Prepare a nice dinner when Mom and Chloe get back. Go to bed earlier. Mom and Chloe coming back tomorrow. Made garlic rice. Copulas in linguistics. Think we have abs? Train intensely for this next month. W summer. Physical excellence. Keep our diet the same though. Keep the water cycle going. Bodybuilding? Had a chat with Jesalina. Looked through our college apps. </p>

Whenever we go to new york, we stay at Thomas’s in astor place. He taught us how to wear ties and talk to girls in high school. It’s been three years since we graduated, and five years since he has. Still when the Browning boys go to new york we all stay over.</p>
<p>The wifi name is philosophy, and the wifi password is thecave. When I went to visit him last summer off the trains, Thomas was living with Ryan. Both of them had dropped out of school to work on their dare livestream platform.</p>
<p>Thomas went two hours on how he was going to reform the architecture of NYU, to make a proper elevated quad inspired by the azabudai hills. He missed the exeter where no one ever knocked on another’s door—you just head on in.</p>
<p>There’s an old joke that men come out of a woman’s legs and spend their whole lives trying to get back in. Thomas’ small flat, where the boys cram together on the couch, is some version of that.</p>
<p>That’s the kind of place we’re looking to find, build, maintain.</p>

As Brian told us: we&#39;re creative enough, we&#39;re risky enough, we&#39;re charismatic enough.
The truth is that most people are lazy and unimaginative. We don&#39;t need to deal with that.</p>

<ul>
<li>NO NEW PROJECTS</li>
<li>keep all expressions of doubt internal (don&#39;t substack about it, don&#39;t talk about it)</li>
<li>Use physical exercise and movement to break ruts—always choose to go out. It will make us feel better.</li>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Woke up in the middle of the night with a cold sweat. 3:00am. Went back to sleep. Slept in. Don&#39;t know what we&#39;ve got ourselves on. Decompress. Our body sore from yesterday. Ginsberg, Moloch. 50 pushups? we feel strong. Sent Bapak some mbah gito updates. Back into the flow. Had some good chicken and ice cream. 萬成. More ice cream—bulk up. Just get calories in us. The cursor flow is so much faster—maybe even worth the 20 dollars. Shipped jyutping to teach ourselves jyutping in 3 hours. We can make a move on indodict. Linkedin posted—(we’ve got to get meaningfully better here) Went outside so we’re not at home all day. Showered. Before the end of this month we ship actionable insights (build the ymal dictionary.) Goal for september is to get one product making revenue (even 1 dollar counts.) Indodict? sleep and rest up now. We’ve been talking to chat more than people this week—and lowkey it’s not terrible. </p>
<p>The recap: we’ve gone farther than expected—we’re 3 shippables ahead of where we wanted to be. Do a stream where we make five bucks.</p>
<p>Go back to exercises in boredom. Looking too forwards is going to make us imbalanced. </p>

<p>[[Webapp Ideas]]: “Collapsible”—a write-or-die editor with no backspace, where “deleted” text is collapsed into footnotes. renders a document that shows the history of strikethroughs (md files?). process is art. the idea is you just continue the sentence // perfect nanowrimo crawl tool.</p>
<p>[[Webapp Ideas]]: Actionable Insights. What are we actually building? <em>Cursor for life</em>. A copilot to nudge you forwards. If cursor&#39;s a chatgpt wrapper for coding, actionable insight is a chatgpt wrapper for leveling up. // write our journal in (.tb), toby code.</p>

<p>[[Big Ticket]] What do we do with our malls? How can we make them non commercialized spaces.</p>
<p>[[Webapp Ideas]] Our first B2B SaaS should be building for UChicago HRL. We know what a pain it is to keep track of and take inventory for laundry and linens (we&#39;ve done it). Make a service that&#39;s going to help lower the amount of hires for summer housing assistant. // Also with Roompact. That shit sucks. If we can just build a tool that lets RA&#39;s and RH&#39;s better keep track of their house in a good way, it&#39;ll work. // We know our shit here and what needs to improved. // Sample idea: instead of filling forms on roompact, record RA/RH weekly checkins and create actionable insights for the house—can be uploaded straight to hrl. Probably more houses will be compliant that way.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Day 23 <strong>Highlight: Latin Discord.</strong><br>Tempus fugit. Chloe’s going back to school tomorrow. The Pillars at Gobekli Tepe. Pillar 27. Our immunization record’s going to be in the mail. Go run. A study of prehistoric religion. Venus of Willendorf. Shakespeare’s Roman Plays. Coriolanus. A Cerebral Renaissance. Get up. Stress the organism. 23 days is not a lot of days. The Bible, Genesis. Moved stuff. Took out the recycling. The luminous mind. Experiencing oneness. The Council of Frogs. Jeremy Zucker kind of night. Went out and sat on the bench for a while. Go out earlier tomorrow. Consider the Lobster and Other Essays. Keep writing. Joined a Latin discord server. We do have twenty something days to spend.

<p>Snippet: <em>Vivamus et amemus.</em> The old poet didn’t tell us that the two are the same. That “to live&#39;&#39; is “to love”. Will always thank Exeter for teaching us to live beautifully, but more than that, to live.</p>
<p>Feeling the “look, look, we’re alive.” of an eager newborn. When did we first realize that we were in the company of those who had been living a while? Still have much to learn. Hope to find the same thing at Chicago. </p>

<p>[[Webapp Ideas]]: Better Avatars. Create cute virtual avatar creatures for AI models to inhabit as a user interface // Kiki bouba-sound to shape // Playpen: allow user to draw their creature, talk to it—then all the creatures interact in a sandbox. // See draw your fish.</p>
<p>[[Substack]] The gift of hindsight. Relate Will Hu’s life thesis and Oliver Drazsky’s anchor. We want to be judged not by our status but by our hunger. AI is the greatest democratization of our time. A kid with a computer can build something for anyone with 5 bucks. Our vision from assisi—second year francis came to tell us in our fever to hollow ourselves out, break bread with strangers. The next summer in the South basement pushing linens around radicalized us. That tremendous waste. Machiavelli on Savonarola—“the armed prophet makes change”</p>
<p>[[Substack]] What we learned from Isaacson&#39;s biography of Steve Jobs is that a company is not its products or idea, but people. See how Jobs pulled top talent into his team and had that talent follow him around. We need a group of people who are really innovative, hungry, and willing to go all night. </p>
<p>[[Substack]]: Plato&#39;s allegory of the cave. If technology is about reducing the barriers of representing ideas in reality, see writing -&gt; painting -&gt; photography, it&#39;s a question of how rich the mindworld is when the mind-world veil weans &gt;&gt; Hayy Ibn Tufayl. Adapt the message so you don&#39;t scare people away. You&#39;re looking for a certain type of person (narrow is the gate), but that type of person is not a type of being, but a type of action. (A builder is not born a builder, a builder is a builder by building.)</p>
<p>[[Substack]] Hacking the mind. in attention and working memory, we learned you can really hold one thing in memory at a time. your working memory capacity is the greatest predictor of success—the real life top gun. kurtzegasatz video on the present being an illusion. we’re great with the long term planning but we’re shit at the short term execution that’s going to get us there. the former is creative while the latter is systematic. solution? outsource that to a machine. Nick Kovalsky taught us to look at processes, look at them like games, that’s how we level up with compounding growth.</p>
<p>[[Substack]] There are these moments that change your perspective and you keep going back to them. We hadn’t seen our dad in two years when he picked us up at Shenzhen. At nanchang, he showed us the product of our generational jump (it was one swim across the river) &gt;&gt; The Aeneas myth. The one qualifier for Aeneas is that he is pious. Pius Aeneas dan (et :)) fidus achates. &gt;&gt; Of course there’s nothing in common I have with these people. It’s the stories that mend us into one family</p>
<p>We’ve got to scale up with the things we build. Actionable insights will be a system not just an app. If we do word games we need to advertise them and make them social.</p>
<p>What we learned from jyutping—it’s lowkey not about technicals at all. People are gonna respond to something emotional even if it’s just mocked up in 2 hours.</p>
<p>For the past week, we’ve been locked in the moment we wake up. Whys that? We’ve probably always had the want or hunger to become better, but how are we carrying forward this momentum? Biotriggers: we get out of bed right away and pack up our cot so we can’t go back to sleep. Brush our teeth and we start thinking. We did check our phone for project updates so maybe we’re being prompted by what we leave yesterday.</p>

Arrived at the end scene with the skyscrapers. Went downstairs and washed some rice. Movies with hyperstylization. La Resurrezione. A study of trufficulture. Felt sad for a large swathe of the day. Took out the trash and took a lap around the neighborhood. Rest up and go running early tomorrow. Brushed our teeth. Restarted our alarm clock. Turn off screens in an hour. </p>

<p>Movie of the summer? Her is still pretty up there. Prey was an experience. But with Taxi Driver, Fight Club, and Nightcrawler, we’re talking about the outlining of an anarchist manifesto, primal responses to the restraints of consumer capitalism. </p>

Walked to Shenzhen station. Met up with dad. Hong Kong, just a couple mountains in the distance. Said goodbye to Aboo and Gonggong. Boarded the train to Nam Cheong. Like great long snakes traversing the continent. Listened to music. Got to Nam Cheong late at night. Dad checked us into a hotel by the station. Showered and slept.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p><strong>Day 22</strong><br>Woke up in the early morning. Called Aboo for a little bit. Made congee and beef. Packed light. Went down to Union Station in the afternoon. Train stations are modern temples. Met Casper from Outokumpu on the N.E Regional, an MIT educated chemical engineer. Said he was headed to a chromium mine in rural Norway. Talked dark side and incentives for decarbonization. Arrived in New York at 5. Walked from Penn Station to Morningside Heights, cross Manhattan, from one end of Central Park to the other. MTA coursing under sewer panes, we heard its rattle. Skaters did ollies in front of the Museum of Natural History. Met up with Arhon with his friends. Saw Aya. Hung out in Cressida’s room (Carlton Arms) with a bunch of Columbia transfers. Subway down to the Bowery Room. Finished Consider the Lobster in a 24/7 deli that we sat at for a couple hours, watching people pass by outside the window. Skewers at a food truck. We had tendons. Hung out until early in the morning. Went back with Arhon to Slic. Slept on a couch in the common room. </p>
<p>Metro Artists: Public Art Project.<br>Who&#39;s the coolest person you know?</p>
<p>Outokumpu is Finnish for Strange Hill. So named because the company’s first mine a hundred years ago was a piece of rock in a different colour than those around it.</p>
<p>Daniel taught us to read the footnotes. We were reading his piece on Metuchen when he stopped us. “If you don’t know Ciardi, Greitzer, and Wilkins Freeman, look them up”. Changed how we read forever. Have to have the curiosity, or perhaps discipline, to not gloss things over.</p>
<p>Hailsham, of course it&#39;s very well still standing here. But you never step in the same river twice, right?</p>

Don’t have our headphones in all the time—listen to ambient sounds. Made the trip down to shenzhen. Climbed for a couple hours. We’re maybe a little too tired. Stress the organism, but climb with good technique. Got to book six of the Aeneid on the train ride back. Called dad. Matcha latte ice cream.</p>

We had our laptop out, he must have assumed we were working—or a student here. Brushed our teeth in the bathroom and grabbed our stuff. Ran into Arhon on our way out. Took the train down to Chinatown for some buns. Went up to Bryant Park to play some chess. Played Samantha from Westchester, then with Jager, an 87 year old Filipino man, who destroyed us. David, who we had met in NOLA, came to visit. Followed Andrew back to Columbia to meet with Kevin at the Ban Ban shop. Sat on the steps. Sunset. Pink wispy clouds. Alma Mater, grandeur. Kira, Grace. Walked Grace home to 106th street. Took the train downtown to see Thomas. Astor place. Ryan Xie, how would you respond to a bucket of sand thrown off the top of the staircase? Picked Arhon up from the Palladium. Nanxiang dumplings, honeycomb ice cream from Van Leewuns. Back at Thomas’. Conversations: think jazz vs classical piano. <em>You can’t rehearse a repertoire because a conversation is jazz.</em> A vision for an NYU quad, elevated like the Azabudai hills, view of the Freedom tower.

Thomas Wang, Ryan Xie, Mino Lee</p>
<p>We are imprints of each other?
We’re drawn to people that are straight out of a Murakami book.
Half of what Thomas was talking about is in Ryan’s article.
We’re all reading the same things—it’s a good sign.</p>
<p>[[Substack]]: Aeneid as a latent protocol.
Summer up Victoria peak we watch the sea and how we’ve carved mountains, we carve ourselves.
Noah Lee told us Chicago is like a finger to the sky—a human affront to god
We build and etch our names across the stars. 
Pious to the gods above, who see us at our weakest. Terque quaterque beati sunt. </p>
<p>[[Substack]]: the game of shadows. dr who in extremis, hayy ibn tufayl, platonic forms, john the word, flesh, light</p>
<p>Notes on a call with Thomas:
Thomas is in NY. Ryan moved out to SF. Last month TWang was in China sourcing rapid test diagnostic providers. Bearish on Japan/Korea. We told him about Indonesia. We&#39;re in the same headspace about family. Tim&#39;s funeral he did go.
Aesop soap, $50-$60 a bottle, indicator of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>wealth to be able to afford it</li>
<li>in on the culture/lifestyle
Better kpi than most luxury brands because its a consumed good. They map out the bougie neighborhoods and not just the cbd. 20 stores in New York, 12 in Seoul, maybe not even 1 in Jakarta. 
Twang&#39;s thesis: the world now selects for autism—differentiated thinking.
Twang pushed us on our life thesis. He tells us his driver is boredom—he wants stimulus. To level up in the game, be in more interesting rooms. (cf Oliver Drazky life anchor, Will Hu’s life thesis)
For us, don&#39;t think just do. Eliminate the fluff. We&#39;re not looking for a cofounder—that&#39;s just to hedge against failure (fear-response). $1 webapp is not the intermediary step we need because $1 problems are not problems worth solving. Inefficiency is a feature not a bug with Institutions, don&#39;t build for UChicago. Blogs are instructive but right now our time is better spent coding/talking to users.
Midcurve meme: make money, live well -&gt; what is a good life? -&gt; make money, live well.
How silly is it to ask &quot;how passionate are you about the dollar?&quot;
Chinese AI movie reel spammer names his repo &quot;money printer.&quot; 
Startups are about de-risking by breaking big problems into little problems.
We&#39;re still just 21—we don&#39;t need to worry about falling off. We just need to be able to make our something big at 30. (35 per Mclaughlin.)</li>
</ul>
<p>What do we admire about Thomas?
He cuts through the fluff instantly.
Persuasive because he notices what we say and can deduce what we mean before we even know it.
Thomas’s dreams and reality graph (summer of our grad) may have changed us</p>
<p>[[Webapp Ideas]] &quot;pathfinder&quot;. An embed/extension that helps users/grandparents easily walk through a website. Mitigates user churn for businesses. Zocdoc/intercom/google analytics-like embed. Attachable to html header.</p>

<li>chatgpt api call to locate correct path by reading through summaries/screenshots</li>
<li>give you the screenshot flow/opens up the website automatically</li>

<p>MVP: ui that lets you plug in a website. maps the directory for you, and gives you a summary of each page</p>
<p>User flow: 
confused about where to go on outdated website -&gt; click on floating widget -&gt; how do I get to x? -&gt; widget gives them the flow or just pulls up the right page on them.</p>
<p>If we do this well, book a flight to New York in October to hack with Thomas a weekend.</p>
<p>What did we do well in the convo?
Reconnected, funneled down to talking about practicals -&gt; clear way to move forward. Call to action in NY. </p>
<p>[[Webapp Ideas]] so many times Chatgpt blabs something that we wish we understood. Ability to click on a word in Chatgpt to have it explain it further? Chrome extension? Think apple books highlight to translate/lookup function.</p>

<p>he takes out a box and we go up to the terrace, where he pours out a glass of whiskey and hands me a cigar. as I put it in my mouth, he weeps.<br>—<br>this month has been a massive nostalgia trip. there’s something funny about seeing old friends. they always look exactly the same as when you last left them. two years is a lot of time, but it all just disappears the moment one’s mouth opens.<br>—<br>2am in new york, turn the corner from washington square park, I’m sitting with arhon and thomas outside nyu’s faculty housing, which looks vaguely post-soviet. arhon talks about the ol’ bhaus basement and says isn’t it funny that he can’t seem to remember any specific conversation we had there. </p>
<p>I think about what I miss and really it is this unabashed rawness that we used to have. here’s a zinger from thomas: “adults don’t lie less, they just learn to lie more substantively”<br>—<br>this past february, brunch with a friend in bartlett as we mull over a new matchmaking service. the thesis: pair people up while giving them absolutely no info about each other. we were going to create serendipity.</p>
<p>two months out, we find 1k at a pitch competition and I secure a 20k scholarship. I say I’m staying in chicago this summer to build<br>—<br>forward two months, I’m pushing a cart of linens around the south basement. and I’m — stuck. I quit my job. I buy a train ticket.</p>
<p>—<br>I must have sounded so strange when I told will in sf that I’ve been consumed recently by the idea of becoming light. Really we’ve been thinking about the human instrumentality project. the question of connection presupposes we ask what is consciousness, what is the soul?</p>
<p>—<br>but then again, sitting in union station a kid comes up to me with soot covered hands and a fresh cut on his right cheek. he asks me for money to go back to shuresville, indiana. I ask him how much is a bus fare. he says 9 dollars and I pull out my last tenner to hand it to him. he says the bus fare is actually 12 dollars. now I don’t know whether to believe him but I have no cash left. </p>
<p>another zinger from thomas: ”what if the problem is us?”<br>—<br>somewhere midori is calling to ask where I am now.<br>I’m sorry I’m so bad at explaining, but really I’m just not quite sure</p>

We seem to be missing a certain Studio Ghibli fan a little extra. Καταδεσμοι, curse tablets. Looked up an area code map of the US. Japanese woodblock prints. Took another google maps tour of Chicago.

Took the early morning shuttle to Haneda. Checked in and sat at a random gate. Three mentaiko onigiris from the vending machine. Little sleep, hungry eyes. Slept lots on the plane. Read through the mock case packet. Watched Yes Man, Terrence the Televangelist. Accept the covenant. </p>
<p>…September 4th again. Got a cool aerial shot of Manhattan. Arrived in JFK. Saw Shawn at Grand Central. Love trains. New England! Back in New Haven. Archie picked us up from Union Station. Ate. Slept. Woke up once in the middle of the night and went back to sleep.  </p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Dimsum with Aboo and Gonggong. Followed them to 買餸. A stereo on loop has replaced the hawker’s yell. Sheung shui to shenzhen. Grinded out at Naixue. Use MCPs. Switched gears and read for a bit. Noodles for lunch. Set an hour timer to climb. There&#39;s a foot path on the first floor that&#39;s quite fun to do—no hands. Did our first overhang route. Straight arms make good work. Pullups. Came back home and showered. FIxed up the aircon. Fixed pathfinder—sent over v1 to Thomas. Keep working. Prereg course pinger? Situational Awareness: The Decade Ahead (we might just get a year of runway, but almost everyone only has a year of runway.) Chloe called. Sleep, go climb tmr. Work on extension. Check out: <a href="https://gumroad.com/">https://gumroad.com/</a></p>
<p>Work where it&#39;s technically hard, because that stops people from catching up. We want to make more money and deliver more value than anyone has ever seen. Think summer we were pushing round the linens.</p>
<p>Current issues with pathfinder:</p>
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> embedding doesn&#39;t work
  Result -&gt; can&#39;t actually rank pages + deployment issues?
  Api crawl encodes embeddings
  Query uses embeddings.</li>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> crawler doesn&#39;t crawl all pages, just sees links in the body and not in a header component?</li>
</ul>
<p>Pathfinder next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>building it into an embed. (pathfinder -&gt; sherpa)</li>
</ul>
<p>[[Big Ticket]] Build for the edge case. How much would Aboo and Gonggong benefit from having someone they could talk to to give them directions? They don’t know how to use google maps. Tech should be that simple —you should be able to talk to it like a person and have it be helpful. That’s the new interface that we’re thinking about—accessible. </p>
<p>[[Webapp Ideas]] Cigar Collection Index (Commissioned by Dad). Maintain a live visual cigar inventory with cost, sale price, brand, and number. Import from excel.</p>
<p>Biotrigger: avoid setting deadlines because deadlines delegate tasks to our future self. Keep the task queue system so if we don’t get to sth today we’ll get to it tmr.
Biotrigger: we tend to write/think the most about an hour from when we wake up.</p>
<p>If we save days from inebriation and intoxication, save days from doubt and sloth. Manage the emotional state, pack up the cot, get up to work. </p>
<p>Do we want to build tmr’s life? Work on thomas’ scraper today. Make sure we&#39;re persistent and not obstinate. Maybe a job/fellowship is what we need. Making a full product and being scrappy will win us jobs though. </p>
<p>Simplify the apps we’re using. Too many flows and not enough depth.
Its ok to let people down. Chirag definitely didn&#39;t do WHPK well at all and now he&#39;s at YC.</p>

Just two days till we’re in Chicago. Crashing with Elijah. Took the bus with mom to Cornell Scott Hill. Got our fillings. Mouth numb. Did pushups. Become a Jeremy Fragrance. Took the bus down to New Haven. Waited for Clark outside Phelps gate. Ran into Chris Shia. Played pool with Clark. Sunset. Grabbed ice cream with Daniel. Walked around and talked. Took the bus and then ran home in the dark. The A team. </p>

Always think that we’re weird or make things weird, or really that we’re ugly. But we’re reminded that people generally like to spend time with us… and that, heck, some people even find us cute. And that’s good enough for us.</p>

The low hanging ferns and fountain. Talked Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis. Picked up two shirts at the Salvation Army thrift store. Ray Troll’s Return of the Sockeye. Set up Sliced Bread Artist Features. Maybe we really ought to take a break from logging—it plays with our memory too much. Most of our classes this quarter are night classes? Sit in on photons to consciousness.</p>
<p>Secured a Tuesday spot for sliced bread artist features. Run media. @buildspace.<br>Research study. Follow 10 pairs of first years around. 20 kids. First Year, the TV show.<br>Amaan Jahangir’s paintings.</p>
<p>We say we dangle between homelessness and greatness but we’re really too close to the former and not the latter.</p>
<p>Notes on our conversation with Clark: the question is can we construct dialects of creativity, innovation? Clark says that’s what McKinsey does. How do we test empirically the extent to which Sapir Whorf is true? Because in some sense it is a tautology: if we talk more about time the more we’re going to think about it. Clark recycled us to look into business negotiations as a particular form of conversation. Something we can engage both with. </p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p><strong>Day 13</strong><br>Rouge skies over Ohio. Back in Central Time. Chicago, concert in the Jackson Red Line station, Bears fans stream out at Roosevelt. Stopped at Clancy’s, who set us up with an air mattress in the basement. Dropped off our stuff. Walked to Trader Joes for some food. Tuscan pane and garlic dip. Ran into Geneva, who invited us to eat and talk in the Cloisters. Talked extended families, tribes of 50+ people. Geneva’s mom is starting a commune—just women and kids though. Stopped by the Robie house, signed up for a tour. Settled in the reg. Reconstructed our New York Days. Stopped by Jewel-Osco. Made dinner. Watched from Dusk till Dawn. Decided to sleep on the basement couch. Which was pretty comfy. </p>
<p>Do Saul-esque stuns.<br>Figure out how we study abroad in Edinburgh<br>Do research. </p>
<p>Notes on Frank Lloyd Wright: Prairie school, organic architecture. What is a place without walls? Compressed ceilings communicate intimacy. Rooms flow into one another. Standing in the main room, looking out towards the prow, it’s like being at the helm of a ship. </p>

<p>When couples argue with each other, it’s not about money or power or sex. What they’re really saying is <em>you’re not enough people</em>.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Day 11<br>Woke up and visited NYU law. Had a double shackburger and a strawberry shake. Left with Nicole to Moynihan Train Hall. Talked while waiting for our trains. Cried to this Side of Paradise. Ran into Siona by Yale’s Old Campus. Met up with Daniel. Ate at Branford college. Modes of social interaction: in college, reconnection over maintenance. Life after the garden of Eden. Took the bus home. Found out who’s behind Exeter compliments. </p>
<p>Stuck in the purgatory of summer.<br>Daniel: how much of home is 14 to 18? </p>

Went down to West Rock again. Felt good. One foot in front of the other. All green day. Had beef tomatoes and egg. The End of the Fing World, our comfort show? Talked to Jasper. A necessary attitude for life. Seagulls cry. Have some Vonneguts. Texted Jesalina.</p>

<p>Happy that we’ve retired our view that the world is against us, the world is open and willing. Summer nights have not eroded us, but made us bare so that we can be clothed.</p>
<p>Short term: Sign up for email lists. Bookstore Code: HELLO22. O-Week Urban Hikes. </p>
<p>A vision for the future:<br>Look into research and fellowships.<br>Keep writing. Write our books.<br>Travel, language? Homefinding.</p>
<p>Memento: Grassroots projects? Davis Projects for Peace. Make our foray into politics? Fulbright. Beware of complacency. Make next summer Gap-Year-esque. Make career counseling our friend. Get our resume reviewed. Ask about Metcalf. Investigative journalism? Tell a story about ourselves. We’re good at that. Become an RA.</p>

Moving Sliced Bread into the arts. E-board. Met Enzo at the bookstore. Josie gave him a quick tour. Assembled Exodia, made a 3x3 grid for sliced bread. Walked with Melody to Michael’s for dinner. The party: Megan Ding, Erik Ely, Hadley, and Rodrigo. Teriyaki Chicken Thighs—we should host some dinners. Walked back to North. Showered. Called Amber and Claire after missing their facetime. </p>
<p>On Sliced Bread, <em>our competition sucks.</em> It’s crazy that there’s not a sizable publication dedicated to the arts on this campus. We can be the best.</p>

Shoshi emailed that we got our building manager job. Finished training. Went back to North and crashed. Sunset. Had dinner with Connor, talked neuralink bandwidth, theory of minds, DFW. Ran into Kavya at CVS. Talked to Oliver and Catalina at Target. Bought shampoo. Don’t go to training tomorrow—rest up and get plastic sleeves for our nat geo maps. Finally gained some headway on our load of laundry. The basement is buttery smooth on our board. r/productivity, r/automation. Swapped marketing management for intro to psych research methods. <em>Leap of faith.</em> The Prophet <em>Veep An Null</em> appeared to us in a dream.</p>

The father gives each a hundred gold coins to fill the room. Bricks, feathers, and candlelight. Room design philosophy is coverage maximization. Caught up with Erik at Nella’s.

<p>Sam Harris from the Center of Teaching and Learning reached out to us, said someone at the Dean’s Office had put forth our name.

Get some sleep before our early morning flight. Genetheto phos, planned deviation from a theme. Published our coolcat. Sacred scrolls and hallowed halls, we’re making a pilgrimage. </p>
<p>Snippet: To oscillate between knowing and unknowing. Apocalypse, Ragnarok, Gotterdammerung. Cycles of death and rebirth. The immensity of the stars over an open field, the forest dark and enchanting, the air washing over you like waves. What Siddartha saw under the bodhi tree, and Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane. Words and pictures provide only facsimiles of feeling, though music gives the best approximation by far. The word of the summer is “natal”. Much wisdom gained and shed this summer.</p>

Took the most freeing dump of our lives by the parking lot at 2:00. Skinny dipped, sat down on the smooth sand—a cold bath. Stayed until 3 when a car showed up. Headlights made floodlights and we were busted. Collin and Melody gave the most unconvincing defense, but the ranger let us go. Walk of shame as we were escorted out of the park.

<p>Been writing in fragments, ostrakoi. Gotta give the what&#39;s up, rundown, awesome hour delivery on the past couple of days: photography, RAing, the act of becoming and producing. Slice bread could be our vision for an artistic revolution. Think we’re ready to return to a philosophy of openness. Embodying Will Park. Fall invincibility. Get ready for more Jaspers—there are people here that will mean a great deal to us, who are at the present moment mere strangers. Hype up!</p>

Rehearsed, rehearsed, rehearsed, then performed. Warmed up in a circle. This collective thing. Pass the Squeeze. The lights were blinding—we gave our monologue. Crowd was awesome. Out on the parapet with Josiah and Ethan. The moon and Saieh. What a high! With Guido on the couch. Exhausted. Walked back to North, showered and slept. The past 48 hours have been so long in the best way.</p>

Stopped at Kavya’s briefly. Ruby Velez. Shabtai was something. Skated along 55. Jackson Giampa, met Sean on our floor, back from two years of South Korean military service. Called mom briefly.

Walked by a Latin and Ballroom dancing session, people taking wedding pictures, a group of Quebecois tourists. Ran into Norton at Plein Air. Saw Taxi Driver on 35mm with Clancy. Grabbed a quick bite at Bart before walking down to Cathey. Soft soft fountain grass on the Midway. The afternoon sun. Talked Sliced Bread with Josie—covered operations, designed a workflow. Lyfted back to north for our meeting with Joe and Cristi. Make our room a studio. Called Chloe. Made eggs. A revelation from Jackie.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Paragon of animals, quintessence of man. IQ bell curve meme, judge, judge not, judge. Read over psych readings. We’re climbing the cursus honorum—on track to be on the Maroon masthead. Edited Articles with Noah and Laine. Followed Clancy to the Ida career fair. Be systematic about how we collect names and contact info. Alex Richardson, who left college for Shanghai, wrote ads for the game Mafia City. The career fair is a rat bucket. Tap access to Maroon HQ. Caught up with Adrian in Hallowed. Roamed about the quad for food. Stamps dinner at Nella—talked to Eshan. UCHRP’s work in Berea. Social networks as it applies to rehabilitation for unhoused drug addicts. Pasta posillipo. Sweet baby mussels whose dignity we appreciated. To think they once saw the light from under the sea. North staff meeting, got to talk in depth with James Evans, who called us “dude!” by the end. International Food Box. The house sang us happy birthday. Talked with Marshall. Did some Greek with Soph and Lola. Carlo’s a big skateboarder. One moment we stepped in his room and it felt like a Browning interaction. Just being able to step in without asking. Convo with Lola, Thomas, and Angelito. Anointed oil on Mount Sinai. Angelito who once killed and prepared a sheep for his family. All glory to the matadores. <em>Lola was being super awkward while we were hanging out in the lounge.</em> What a great birthday! Shanah Tovah. Uma boji masiso, kureso, pagaso. Borrowed Yuen’s printer. Watched Korean Culinary Wars with Angel. </p>
<p>Notes from convo with James Evans: 1. grew up in California, train hopped with his dad when he was a kid. Rode the freight trains everywhere from Sacramento, up to Portland, but also west to Winnemucca and Salt Lake. Sometimes feet dangle miles up in the Sierra Nevadas in box cars. One time a chair with a broken leg, and a mouse looked straight into his eyes.</p>
<p>2. College student at Brigham Young now. Spent 3 months on the streets doing ethnographies of the homeless. Observing this complex community, pitched right next to their tents. One time to a kind schizophrenic. <em>Hey man I have to tell you the truth</em>—<em>I’m actually a sociology student</em>. And without a beat, he says, <em>me too</em>. Mindfuck, maybe just echolalia. Look into Evicted by Matthew Damond. </p>
<p>3. Populating AI societies now, just having AI’s talk to each other. Because we need to find ways to check superpowered intelligence. Kings were a type of power, and in 1260 we made one sign the magna carta./ Asked James Evans how he ended up from 2 to 3, and he said what he’d been studying the whole time is “collective intelligence”. “It just happened to be that most intelligence used to be human.”</p>

Will Hu at Moda, reminds us a lot of Will Park actually. Met Guang and Aman at the A level. Followed Aman to Henry Josephson’s. UChicago’s Effective Altruists would make for a good ethnography. Went out to midnight soccer with Billy, Aviral, Marshall, Henry and Kali. Ended up playing world cup among ourselves. House study break. Wrote out our remaining board intros with Lola.

<p>Amigo x Raghu: (perhaps a paradigm shift) envision what we’re building as a tool not for the match-made but for the matchmakers. Give people interested in connecting their friends an easy way to do that. a.k.a <em>I Think You Should Meet.</em> More akin to a paperless post than hinge.</p>

<p>SB: Group meetings are not efficient or effective. Maybe the way we do it is schedule 1 on 1’s with Courtney (for social media) and Kavya (for artist features). Create a branding guide with Courtney—will help both with direction and longevity. Make ourselves the master of the social calendar. </p>

Had a really good talk with Peter from our FA class. <em>Exeter, Chicago, we’ve got something.</em> Figured out our FA stuff. Three bowls of soup with Alec and Max from UChicago Sailing. Dropped by the reg. Abecedarian. Talked to Judy at Ex Lib. We need a moodboard—branding is about knowing our customer. Went to SliC. Grabbed dinner at Baker. T-5 to finish our stats homework. Hosted our first study break. Brought home a little plant friend. Submitted our stats homework. We’re an extreme R goat. Made some really cool graphs. Shower and read so that we can compose an essay tomorrow. </p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Woke up. Went to volunteer at the South Side Science Festival. There’s Grace Li from Columbia, who Will Park took pictures of for Rat Rock. She’s now a first year phd student in the compsci department, working under Dr. Mina Lee in the UChicago Communications and Intelligence group. <em>We thought she was really pretty</em>. Got to talk with Su Yian as well, another phd student, about how the Chinese music scene has evolved. 草东没有派对, 我的滑板鞋. Went to the CNVC kickoff. Faradawn was there. Met Simon working on an athlete recruitment platform. Got his number and asked to grab lunch. Intro’d Marshall and Colbert at Bart. Stopped by the North/Max P carnival. Great music. Had multiple bowls of tofu rice from the Asian food truck. Got to talk to Chloe Eng. Napped for a bit before heading to the corduroy function at Evgenia’s. Rishi lent us his flannel. Noah and Leo on the bean bags. We were so serious. Talked idealism vs pragmatism. Walked home with Finn, Claudia, Daniel Mata and his friend. Met Matthew with a skateboard coming out of North. Cruised down Ellis with him to the quad. First meeting of skate club.</p>
<p>Ben Burgess: arranged marriages can work because people work through incompatibilities vs when people have full agency, they filter. The problem about info is that we create narrow definitions of each other, and when they don’t match up irl, we have a negative reaction. If we’re building a matchmaker aid, interview matchmakers</p>
<p>Why are we suspicious of digital solutions to interpersonal relationships? Because authenticity is key, and we usually judge authenticity by the amount of effort it takes for someone to do something. Given that digital makes everything easier, how do we find a way to communicate authenticity? Paperless post does this really well—when we got sent the invite from Shabtai we felt valued, even if we were one of two dozen people sent the same invite. </p>
<p>To Noah and Leo: no need to reinvent the wheel. We connect by outsourcing to the connectors.</p>

<p>All social engineers are extreme, it takes a lot to think—I want to change how people live. Social engineers are just smart about how they package their message. e.g “wise as serpents and innocent as doves.” They understand that they must build a strong core of zealots (Pinchas), in order to reach the laypeople (secular Franciscans). They are also keenly aware of how scary the unfiltered truth can be to the unconverted (angels say “be not afraid.”) Take, “I come not to bring peace, but a sword.” Christ wanted to dissolve families. Christ, Marx, Zuckerberg—they’re all in the same category for us. They’re <em>teachers, rabbi, educators</em>.</p>

<p>Meta apparently has postdocs. Most companies have innovation wings. Think of SBAF as Sliced Bread’s innovation division. SB nanowrimo?</p>
<p>Hunger, sex, and power’s domination in contemporary sociological discourse have contributed to a reductive view of humanity. Self-actualization, transcendence, a need for meaning, these things which we conventionally prescribe to “higher ideals” may themselves be fundamental drivers of behavior. <em>Cloth mama</em> (Harry Harlow)<em>, God.</em> Take micromanagement—is it that people abuse power or that people want to feel useful? We need a new social theory. Only by reinterpreting what human nature is can we lend possibility to visions that better living. Idealism is always pragmatic in that way. </p>
<p>After we told Paul about Estrella’s last farewell app and asked him to keep us updated about anyone working in that genre, he told us that student entrepreneurship seems to be going in the other direction. “Things are more ‘hollow’,” he said, “however, technology has always existed, and for any movement there is a reaction”. The more we automate and find ourselves slipping into hyper efficiency, there will be a pushback and yearning for authenticity. And we’ll be there. </p>
<p>Babylon is the super-structuralization of man, which now confines him, which he calls <em>the machine</em>. Society—our social product has become something that estranges us. Put simply, the city makes us lonely because it deprives us of <em>neighbors.</em> The solution? Make our communities smaller. Restore the neighborly bond. To start, we have only need to care for those immediate to us.</p>
<p>Evolution:</p>
<p>V1: The Button<br>Thesis: abundance of information offered via social media has led to decreased patience in getting to know others irl “the hinge effect”; phones create barriers which have eliminated most opportunities for chance meetings; isolationist norms make it socially unacceptable to approach people you don’t know.<br>In a nutshell: stranger proximity matching.<br>Execution: Red button provides you with a match identified solely by name and clothing.<br>Problem: <strong>critical mass</strong>—need enough people to opt in in the same space in order for us to provide spontaneous matches. <strong>bad apples</strong>—no social guarantee that everyone on the app is benign, general inability to filter out malicious agents. <strong>no exit</strong>—no way to comfortably exit an awkward interaction in which one party wants to exit but the other does not.</p>
<p>V2: Amigo<br>Thesis: mutuals provide social credibility for yet-to-meet parties; semi-strangers within a network lead to higher likelihood of positive interactions while retaining serendipity.<br>In a nutshell: matchmaking via mutuals.<br>Execution: contact upload. amigo matches you with someone with whom you share a mutual.<br>Problems: <strong>critical mass</strong>—people often have positive experiences meeting mutuals but aren’t incentivized enough to actively seek out these meetings. <strong>clashing expectations</strong>—no way to define engagement for either party, is it romantic, platonic, for business? <strong>fallout</strong>—amigo is responsible/viewed as responsible if an interaction goes bad.</p>
<p>V3: I Think You Should Meet<br>Thesis: outsourcing matchmaking to a matchmaker who is able to set expectations for both parties and provide a reason for their engagement. Single-user-tool solves critical mass problem inherent for social platforms.<br>In a Nutshell: paperless post for two.<br>Problems: <strong>doubt of authenticity</strong>—how do we make the email not look like a scam/the sender got hacked? <strong>Privacy</strong>—how do we monitor appropriate use of the emails?</p>
<p>What are our career plans? What are we doing after we graduate? Paul asked. All we know is that we need to be in the right rooms. Exeter was the first room we got into. CNVC was last, what’s next? Have to be in the AI space. It’s gold or shovels. Be prescient. </p>
<p>Was just thinking today that for our brief two decades of life on this planet we’ve come very far. Circumnavigated the globe, got to meet a truly wide array of people. It’s been a storied life.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Breakfast at Baker. Greek yogurt with dried mangos. Picked up our UPass. Settled in Bart. Ate with Elijah, Rina and Jesenia. Taiwanese indie, the Chairs. Fight the grey. Went to our micro lecture. Ate with Lucy and Audrey. Had our Firebird interview at Ex Lib—actually really want to be part of the club now. Went to the Harper cubicles to finish our micro pset with Kaan, Yuto and Audrey. Went down to Cathey with Yuto afterwards. The Chicago Kabuki Club. IM Volleyball. Grabbed a water at fourth meal. Returned to work on Stats with Rose. Cut our hair. </p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Woke up. Showered. Rushed over to 1155 for Involved Interviewing. Bean soup in Woodlawn. Had a great chat with Harris. Went to the Maroon office in Ida. Worked. Called mom briefly. The lives of others—Apotheosis of Augustus (Tristes Tropiques). Lab night. Rat brains. SB in Bartlett lounge. Four corners. Stayed after to close shop. Washed knives. Aabir stopped by. Called dad briefly. Went onto the roof of Ryerson with the astronomical society. Now we’ve thrice missed the aurora. Watched About Time. </p>
<p>Stamps Budget Planning:<br>6 quarters (2200) + 1 summer (5000). Try to hit $2500 this quarter, which is 166hrs of work. Means we work ~20hr a week on our project. Otherwise estimate big costs.</p>
<p>Notes from a conversation with Harris:<br>There’s a religious idea that the truth is something that has to be transmitted through fiction, because its pure essence contains an inherent ineffability. Our cups, bowls, and chairs are ersatz representations of their perfect concept. Because our current technologies of communication: writing, painting, photography, sculpture, all contain a level of inefficiency—what we are able to realize is always a little off from what’s in our mind. <em>Neuralink</em> provides an exciting alternative. What will it mean when bandwidth can fully capture and encode thought with no information loss. So developments in neuroscience and artificial intelligence mean that questions we’ve pondered in philosophy and religion for two millenia are now in the realm of technology. Subjective experience capture, “soul” encoding, these are no longer theoretical but practical questions. Towards a realization of God.</p>
<p>Harris thinks that we lack heroes. There is no one in our generation for which we can say, what would [Jesus] do? The problem may really be two. One that no such figures exist (the closest seem to be internet personalities like David Goggins), and two that consumerism has rendered us all faithless. </p>
<p>Godhood is a very delicate illusion to uphold. We need people to be more upset about things. </p>
<p>UI/UX design, human-tech interaction, that’s probably the closest to what we’re interested in doing for a living. Because it requires some serious thought. One has to imagine themselves as the user. Seek out a mentor in that space. Could be James Evans, could be Mina Lee, could be Paul, could be Simon.   </p>
<p>II: Interview flowchart<br>Is it a yes no question?<br>Is it one question?<br>Is there an ambiguous concept (e.g “community)?<br>Can the question be simpler?<br>Can the question be less specific? (e.g take out favourite, most)<br>Is the question for the person you’re talking to?<br>Is the question judgy?<br>Is the question leading?<br>Helpful constructions: “walk me through”, “tell me about”.<br>“Sociologists say xxx, what do you think about that?”</p>
<p>Amigo. Chloe: check out you should meet app. Have to reconsider <strong>the initiator problem</strong>, who initiates?</p>
<p>Dreamt that we met beabadoobee off the street walking with dad and invited her for a quick bite. Stopped by a 大排檔. The owner kept confusing our order of flan and fries, so that when we turned around beabadoobee was gone.</p>

Grabbed Saffron. Found our hippo at Swift. Religion. Caught up with Josh. Talking about nanotubes. Go see the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, recommendation via Daniel. RAs talking about unionizing.

Talked to Annie on the train, who we met while evangelizing Sliced Bread last year. Talked about the &quot;recruiting&quot; tool that we&#39;re building. Met Jasper and Holden outside of the Field Museum. See - [[Field Museum Visit with Holden and Jasper]]. Into Ancient Egypt. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali">Kali</a> of the bottomless void and infinite womb. Took the red to Chinatown. Fueled up. Broke our vegetarian streak for some 担担面 and 红油抄手. Back home. Slept. Woke up in a daze. Finished watching [[About Time]]. Made more sandwiches. Took Jasper to [[Klubnacht]]. Spent some time there before dropping him off at [[Calista]]&#39;s. Returned for a brief conversation with [[Nikhil]], whom we offered some water.

Psych Research Methods: apologized to Mabel for starting off the wrong foot. Noodles Etc. Ate with [[Luke]]. Nhan in town. Picked up our mice. We really did love our logitech M310. Had apple pie. Folded a crane and swung by [[Lincoln]]&#39;s birthday. Stopped by [[Elijah]]&#39;s. Saw so many of our friends from first year in IHouse. and [[Francisco Gutierrez]], and [[Yuto]]. Walked [[Chris]] back home. Moment of transcendence cruising down Ellis, coming from a party where we&#39;ve seen so many of our friends we haven&#39;t seen in a year or more.

Lincoln: &quot;As many of you may know, I grew up in the church of the latter day saints&quot;..which means I grew up Mormon...for most of my life I never thought I would drink, a couple years ago that changed. I decided that I would drink at some point in my life, and that point became my twenty-first birthday&quot;. &quot;I&#39;m scared right now because I&#39;ve never done anything conscious-altering and my life&#39;s been pretty great&quot;...&quot;but there is something about having experiences that you know nothing about. life&#39;s made of these moments, and there are fewer and fewer of them as you grow up.&quot;</p>
<p>Talked to Sameera. What Zac is doing is optogenetically disrupting neural pathways in rat brains to test their brain plasticity. Will a rat still learn to make hot chocolate when we send him a little shock? It’s mapping out schema and engrams. </p>

Brain, memory, learning, frontal cortex, hippocampus, neural network, neural plasticity, schema, engrams.</p>
<p>Convo with Luke:
Will Petty, cartographer of the Irish isles, was really an information scientists. Scholarship and imperialism are so intertwined, though we like to think that technology is always progressive. / And really our justice systems are quite arbitrary. we cannot have a good understanding of justice until we understand the self. Because is a man 20 years out in prison the same that committed the crime? What good does pain do? Why is our response to a crime (a sort of social friction) the expulsion of the criminal agent from society (see [[Levi Strauss]]) Blame solitary confinement on the Quakers. Maybe the sensical approach is slavery. He who kills another man’s son has to become his son. We repair and grow the fabric of society by becoming even more enmeshed with one another.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Woke up. Showered. Collin handed us the HRL bag. Breakfast at Baker. Went through psych notes, quizzes, and the textbook. Midterm. Ate with [[Thomas]]. Responded to emails. Nap, refresh. Catch up. Look into &quot;Akiyas&quot; as real estate opportunities. Reach out to the people at <a href="https://www.gethalfbaked.com/">Half Baked</a>. Dinner with [[Alec]]. &quot;The apples are ripe&quot;. Went to our Fire Escape films meeting. Read about the brain. Stopped by Trott&#39;s acai bowl study break with [[Alec]]. Alec recced us transcendence. Met [[Aman]] and [[Guangxinyang]] at the reg to talk about [[Amigo]]. We need a rebrand, the current signaling is that we&#39;re a space for people who <em>need</em> friends, and that&#39;s taboo. [[Signaling]] is important. </p>
<p>For our [[Amigo]] pilot, pitched [[Aman]], [[Guangxinyang]], and us each inviting three of our friends via email (like how [[Colin Yuan]] invited us to [[Windy Ventures]]) to Aman&#39;s place for dinner. Will be nice to be intentional with this group (our maybe zealots)</p>

<p>Her (2013) is very real now. A couple of days ago a kid killed himself and left his last words to a character.ai Daenerys Targaryen chatbot. The company pulled the whole franchise off from its website, and now threads upon threads are redditors explaining how deeply connected they were to their AIs.</p>
<p>Look into Autotab. Think about what we learned this summer from working in housing. How it frustrated us that people don&#39;t mind wasting time when we can make processes more efficient.  </p>
<p>Alex Banayan&#39;s thing was ditching finals to study the Price is Right. Eric Zhu&#39;s thing is working out of the bathroom as a kid. is our thing quitting our job and riding the train? It&#39;s good that we&#39;re the type of person to wear a big bread sign around. </p>
<p>Part of the difficulty of being a talk show host is filling the time intelligently. The interview format helps greatly—why don’t we get an AI interviewer to prod and ask us questions? [[Webapp Ideas]]: ChatGPT shell. Self interviewer.</p>

[[Guangxinyang]] came to sing. So many of our friends came by, including [[Gertie]] from Lives of Others, [[BJ]] from involved interviewing, and [[Cecily]] from Lives of Others.

Teju Cole. Hannah Arendt. Be well read again.
Gothic fiction grew out of sentimental fiction, a genre that believed feeling was critical to philosophy.</p>
<p>[[Keep in Mind]]: Rule of parsimony. Don’t build startups around people’s second step behaviours. e.g don’t try to build to get someone to do something that is good for them. Rephrase the thesis when that happens.</p>
<p>[[Puppet Lab Observation]]: The <a href="https://chicagopuppetfest.org/">Chicago Puppet Fest</a> has a puppet artist incubator and they just announced their lineup. Could do a longform observation following these puppet artists around and interviewing them. </p>

The falafel sandwich we had was really quite good. It was moist, especially with the tzaziki sauce. We could have had much more of it. Stopped by Aabir&#39;s.

<p>It&#39;s a curious feeling watching the election on a college campus.

<p>After Election Day: Disbelief is perhaps what&#39;s most dangerous about the democrat attitude right now—an inability to understand how Trump not only won but won decisively. Because minorities and women did vote for Trump. And note the media strategy, Celebrities came out in droves to back Kamala, but Trump had the Joe Rogans, personalities who actually got voters to turn out. Think about Alberto, our via driver—what do <em>people</em> actually care about? — The DNC really messed this one up. After the &quot;joy&quot; subsides, people will start to wonder how the democrats ever got behind Kamala, knowing she polled 4% against Joe Biden back in 2020.</p>

Michael Reeve&#39;s Reef.ly. Felt so rushed this morning. Got to class and found out our IG is due next week. We&#39;re chilling. Reached out to Gabe to chat tomorrow about class and interviewing. Nap, shower. <em>Still in the 95 to 100.</em> Our legs are a little sore. Showered. BM Shift. [[Noah]] stopped by and told us to re-read Catcher in the Rye. Caught up with appdev. Man we&#39;re good.

Users submit sentiment analysis. 
Display phrase, and users can mark as positive or negative.</p>
<p>Or maybe users are shown two products and asked which products they would choose to purchase. They are given a budget to spend from. 
Can test menus—give an option for restaurant to enter in items and prices. </p>

<p>Doctrine: A development on our theology. Light, the word, and flesh all encode information—they are creators of intelligence in the shapeless void and vehicles of the self. The flesh is the body we perceive each other. The word is the form of our consciousness. And light, that is the character of our soul, the origin of being, distinguished from consciousness as something more abstract, a feeling. </p>

<p>What we&#39;ve learned from this past quarter. Take small classes. Self-selection among peers is key. Get to know our profs. Could settle for graduating bizecon with a bunch of miscellaneous electives. Don&#39;t waste our time in classes we don&#39;t enjoy. Building courses &gt; reading courses. Pragmatics &gt; theory. Education + opportunities &gt; what it says on our diploma.</p>
<p>Percentage of course feedback responses is key. If most people chose to fill out the form—they either really cared about the class or really hated it. Most likely it&#39;s the former.</p>

EXTREME STEALTH CAMPING. Watched Tenet. Think one way transmissions. Did 30 pushups. Called [[Aboo]] with [[Mom]] and [[Chloe]]. Went out to run. Down the road one mile, keen to avoid plantar fasciitis. Showered. In the midst of an imagined argument with Justin who stiffed us, we stopped to think—how nice is it to have hot water? how nice it is to have food? how nice it is to see Mom and Chloe? Washed the dishes. Tenet, what a movie. </p>

<p>A day of no electronics. We realized we had two big urges to beat: the urge to record and the urge to check up on messages from other people. We have to beat both in order to 1. live in the present and 2. to stop living reactionarily. </p>
<p>In terms of what happened: we read through most of Ishiguro&#39;s Remains of the Day. In the morning, we ran for about a mile before pain set in. Went down to Audi&#39;s to pick up scallions and a gallon of milk from mom. Met a man there who let us go first in line. Talked briefly—he said he was spending thanksgiving with his two daughters. In the evening, we sewed up our pants. Rediscovered Chloe&#39;s mp3 player which had the Duff installed. Chloe was in our room digging up old gadgets.</p>
<p>This was one of the few days that we were really awake and realized how fragmentary our consciousness had become. We do not have a mind of a lion (yet), we are more like a frightened animal. It would do us some good to dopamine detox further.</p>

We are a solitary beam of light. </p>

<p>This past quarter we&#39;ve ditched a sordid past (bizecon) and developed a course plan around the question of other people. We began from a question of how we connect with one another, but increasingly it has become a question of co-presence. How do we deal with the inconvenience (berlant)? what do we do when another face (levinas) confronts our sense of self and control? Our survival depends upon our sociality, yet there is an inevitable friction that in the highest stages becomes a source of suffocation. </p>

Made congee for breakfast. Our little food channel. Tropic Thunder is wild. Texted Jackie. 22 responses on our sliced bread form! Make our first meeting back really good. Learn DaVinci Resolve. Went out for a two miler. The mist. Visions from dreams we put into words. </p>
<p>Doctrine: Our faith, a budding theology. The question of human existence is, in its most pragmatic form, what is suffering and how do we resolve it. Our first proposition: loneliness. A separation of our consciousness via the prisons of our flesh. <em>Man can you understand me</em>. </p>

why are people good at conventional dimensions of achievement (e.g school) more likely to succeed at x? not necessarily because cdoa is related to x, but because people who excel in cdoa have skills that apply to x.

Wrapped ourselves up. Took a nap. A 3-year plan for Sliced Bread: from a club to an artistic revolution on campus. <em>Mind dwelling, softly reminiscing.</em> Scarlett Johanson in A24’s Under the Skin. Heading out to New York tomorrow. Finished our writeup of FESAP, submitted to Fire Escape. Finally got to making our mini vlogs—Singapore career trek and last day in HK. Uploaded a short to our youtube channel, Toby Cosmos. Look into enlarger lenses. Packed our things for tomorrow.</p>
<p>20, two decades of us. In the rare temporal niche of this 21st century… in an exceptional company of people. Composites of composites. Would be wrong not to share what we are so grateful for. </p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Day 2<br>Woke up to morning mist. Last day of the year. Took a long nap. Talked to Indigo. Pack tonight. Things are going to get busy when we get to Chicago. See what tomorrow brings. Kahlil Gibran’s <em>The Astronomer</em>. To bare our hearts under the stars. Worked on our Pareto app. The parochial mind cannot comprehend pizza box sushi. Arrested Development. </p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Day 3<br>Woke up. Grabbed lunch at a 99. Got back home. Collapsed. Napped and showered. Cleaned up the back of our hair. Dropped our Calvino class. Swapped it out for a business elective on management. Get back to work! Fast times at Ridgemont High.</p>
<p>New York in the eyes of a Chicago underdog.<br>Corky Lee’s Asian America.<br>2 hours to go, to echo the tenth doctor, we don’t want to!</p>
<p>Snippet: Messianic dreams bring evangelical compulsions. Our closest-kept secret, out of the brutal pessimism of the world, an unending optimism for the self. One last transmission from 2023: never forget how much that piece of sky meant to us this summer. God bless the whimsy, stay dreaming.</p>

        <div class="compare-entry-content"><p>Had Casa da India leftovers for breakfast. Cold octopus. Spent a minute just sitting in the sunroom, feeling the morning come in through the window. Lisbon lounge. Bacalhau croquettes. Madrid. Wandered. Finished the Road. 8 books this year. Updated our goodreads account. Reading is probably our best bet at fighting fragmentation—it&#39;s a habit of consistency. Hope it&#39;ll roll over to writing. NYE.</p>

<p>Summer on the bus. Clancy: it&#39;s bad when it&#39;s clear that the author is lying, it&#39;s worse when it&#39;s clear they&#39;re lying to themselves/ real naive question, how do we deal with all that overwhelming suffering everywhere in the world/ think party at evgenia&#39;s with noah lee and leo. our talk of idealism and pragmatism/ heuristic: <em>this matters</em> or <em>this doesn&#39;t matter</em>/ all we can do now is fight fragmentation/ thank god for having visited the city of san francisco.</p>
